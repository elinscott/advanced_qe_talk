  abstract = {The design of correlated materials challenges researchers to combine the maturing, high throughput framework of DFT-based materials design with the rapidly-developing first-principles theory for correlated electron systems. We review the field of correlated materials, distinguishing two broad classes of correlation effects, static and dynamics, and describe methodologies to take them into account. We introduce a material design workflow, and illustrate it via examples in several materials classes, including superconductors, charge ordering materials and systems near an electronically driven metal to insulator transition, highlighting the interplay between theory and experiment with a view towards finding new materials. We review the statistical formulation of the errors of currently available methods to estimate formation energies. Correlation effects have to be considered in all the material design steps. These include bridging between structure and property, obtaining the correct structure and predicting material stability. We introduce a post-processing strategy to take them into account.},

In particular, TRIQS/DFTTools together with TRIQS allows an efficient implementation of DFT plus dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations. It supplies tools and methods to construct Wannier functions and to perform the DMFT self-consistency cycle in this basis set. Post-processing tools, such as band-structure plotting or the calculation of transport properties are also implemented. The package comes with a fully charge self-consistent interface to the Wien2k band structure code, as well as a generic interface that allows to use TRIQS/DFTTools together with a large variety of DFT codes.

In order to make these calculations possible for a larger community there is need for high-level methods that allow the construction of DFT+DMFT calculations in a modular and efficient way. Solution method: We present a Fortran/Python open-source computational library that provides high-level abstractions and modules for the combination of DFT with many-body methods, in particular the dynamical mean-field theory. It allows the user to perform fully-fledged DFT+DMFT calculations using simple and short Python scripts. Running time: Tests take less than a minute; otherwise highly problem dependent.},

The singlet state of the \$\$\{\{\textbackslash rm\{Cu\}\}\}\_\{2\}\{\{\textbackslash rm\{O\}\}\}\_\{2\}\$\$Cu2O2 core is thought to be stabilised by a superexchange pathway, but detailed in situ computational analysis is complicated by the multi-reference character of the electronic ground state. Here, electronic correlation effects in the functional site of hemocyanin are investigated using a novel approach, treating the localised copper 3d electrons with cluster dynamical mean field theory. This enables us to account for dynamical and multi-reference quantum mechanics, capturing valence and spin fluctuations of the 3d electrons. Our approach explains the stabilisation of the experimentally observed di-Cu singlet for the butterflied \$\$\{\{\textbackslash rm\{Cu\}\}\}\_\{2\}\{\{\textbackslash rm\{O\}\}\}\_\{2\}\$\$Cu2O2 core, with localised charge and incoherent scattering processes across the oxo-bridge that prevent long-lived charge excitations. This suggests that the magnetic structure of hemocyanin is largely influenced by the many-body corrections.},

Serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography has been used to obtain radiation damage-free structures. However, it remains to be established whether “diffraction-before-destruction” is actually accomplished or if significant changes are produced by the high-intensity X-ray pulses during the femtosecond scattering measurement. Here, we use ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to estimate the extent of structural changes induced on the femtosecond time scale. We found that the radiation damage is dependent on the bonding and charge of each atom in the OEC, in a manner that may provide lessons for XFEL studies of other metalloproteins.

Amunts et al. determined the high-resolution structures of complete mammalian mitoribosomes using cryoelectron microscopy. Mitoribosomes include an unusual mRNA binding channel. The findings elucidate how aminoglycoside antibiotics can inadvertently inhibit mitoribosomes and how mutations in mitoribosomes can lead to disease.Science, this issue p. 95The highly divergent ribosomes of human mitochondria (mitoribosomes) synthesize 13 essential proteins of oxidative phosphorylation complexes. We have determined the structure of the intact mitoribosome to 3.5 angstrom resolution by means of single-particle electron cryogenic microscopy. It reveals 80 extensively interconnected proteins, 36 of which are specific to mitochondria, and three ribosomal RNA molecules. The head domain of the small subunit, particularly the messenger (mRNA) channel, is highly remodeled. Many intersubunit bridges are specific to the mitoribosome, which adopts conformations involving ratcheting or rolling of the small subunit that are distinct from those seen in bacteria or eukaryotes. An intrinsic guanosine triphosphatase mediates a contact between the head and central protuberance. The structure provides a reference for analysis of mutations that cause severe pathologies and for future drug design.}

This distinction is useful from the magnetic point of view because in insulators the spins and magnetic moments whose alignments lead to magnetic effects are certainly localizable so that phenomenologically is described by a spin Hamiltonian that contains spin operators and exchange terms of Heisenberg type. It discusses that there is relationship among the mechanisms important in metals, such as conduction electron polarization, and those in insulators. The chapter provides historical discussion of the subjects of antiferromagnetism and of exchange in insulators. It focuses on the Heisenberg Hamiltonian, with a brief derivation and a discussion of some of the statistical theories of magnetism based upon it, primarily molecular field theory, which is by far the most generally useful in the experimental measurement of exchange. The chapter also describes older theories and presents ideas about super-exchange, and gives a discussion and a diagrammatic classification of all the possible higher-order processes.},

We compare results for C 6 for small and medium-sized molecules with existing results obtained using more cumbersome methods. The computational simplicity of the functional opens up the possibility to treat large systems of real interest within different fields of physics, chemistry and biology.

Phys. 124, 074103 (2006)10.1063/1.2168456] is reformulated, overcoming some of the numerical limitations encountered and extending its range of applicability. We first recast the problem in terms of induced polarization charges that act as a direct mapping of the self-consistent continuum dielectric; this allows to define a functional form for the dielectric that is well behaved both in the high-density region of the nuclear charges and in the low-density region where the electronic wavefunctions decay into the solvent. Second, we outline an iterative procedure to solve the Poisson equation for the quantum fragment embedded in the solvent that does not require multigrid algorithms, is trivially parallel, and can be applied to any Bravais crystallographic system. Last, we capture some of the non-electrostatic or cavitation terms via a combined use of the quantum volume and quantum surface [M. Cococcioni, F. Mauri, G. Ceder, and N. Marzari, Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 145501 (2005)10.1103/PhysRevLett.94.145501] of the solute. The resulting self-consistent continuum solvation model provides a very effective and compact fit of computational and experimental data, whereby the static dielectric constant of the solvent and one parameter allow to fit the electrostatic energy provided by the polarizable continuum model with a mean absolute error of 0.3 kcal/mol on a set of 240 neutral solutes. Two parameters allow to fit experimental solvation energies on the same set with a mean absolute error of 1.3 kcal/mol.

Phys. 124, 074103 (2006) https://doi.org/10.1063/1.2168456.] is reformulated, overcoming some of the numerical limitations encountered and extending its range of applicability. We first recast the problem in terms of induced polarization charges that act as a direct mapping of the self-consistent continuum dielectric; this allows to define a functional form for the dielectric that is well behaved both in the high-density region of the nuclear charges and in the low-density region where the electronic wavefunctions decay into the solvent. Second, we outline an iterative procedure to solve the Poisson equation for the quantum fragment embedded in the solvent that does not require multigrid algorithms, is trivially parallel, and can be applied to any Bravais crystallographic system. Last, we capture some of the non-electrostatic or cavitation terms via a combined use of the quantum volume and quantum surface [M. Cococcioni, F. Mauri, G. Ceder, and N. Marzari, Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 145501 (2005) https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.94.145501.] of the solute. The resulting self-consistent continuum solvation model provides a very effective and compact fit of computational and experimental data, whereby the static dielectric constant of the solvent and one parameter allow to fit the electrostatic energy provided by the polarizable continuum model with a mean absolute error of 0.3 kcal/mol on a set of 240 neutral solutes. Two parameters allow to fit experimental solvation energies on the same set with a mean absolute error of 1.3 kcal/mol. A detailed analysis of these results, broken down along different classes of chemical compounds, shows that several classes of organic compounds display very high accuracy, with solvation energies in error of 0.3-0.4 kcal/mol, whereby larger discrepancies are mostly limited to self-dissociating species and strong hydrogen-bond-forming compounds.},

  abstract = {The local density approximation (LDA) to the density functional theory (DFT) has a continuous derivative of the total energy as a function of the number of electrons and continuous exchange–correlation potential, while in exact DFT both functions should be discontinuous as the number of electrons goes through an integer value. We propose an ad hoc orbital density functional (ODF) (with orbitals defined as Wannier functions) that by construction obeys this discontinuity condition. Taking its variation, the one-electron equations are obtained with a potential in the form of a projection operator. This operator increases the separation between occupied and empty bands, thus curing an LDA deficiency—systematic underestimation of the energy gap value. The minimization of the ODF gives the ground-state orbital and total electron densities. In addition to that we define the ODF fluctuation Hamiltonian that allows one to treat dynamical correlation effects. The dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) with the quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method for an effective impurity problem was used to solve this Hamiltonian. We have applied the ODF method to the problem of the metal–insulator transition in lanthanum trihydride LaH3−x. In the LDA calculations for all values of hydrogen nonstoichiometry x the ground state of this material is metallic, while experimentally the system is insulating for x{$<$}0.3. The ODF method gave a paramagnetic insulator solution for LaH3 and LaH2.75 but metallic state for LaH2.5.},

In biology, generation of fuel due to water oxidation happens efficiently on an immense scale during the light reactions of photosynthesis. To oxidize water, photosynthetic organisms have evolved a highly conserved protein complex, Photosystem II. Within that complex, water oxidation happens at the CaMn4O5 inorganic catalytic cluster, the so-called oxygen-evolving complex (OEC), which cycles through storage “S” states as it accumulates oxidizing equivalents and produces molecular oxygen. In recent years, there has been significant progress in understanding the OEC as it evolves through the catalytic cycle.

For the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) hybrid family of exchange-correlation functionals (i.e., for an approximate generalized Kohn-Sham theory) this implies that (i) the highest occupied molecular orbital corresponds to the ionization potential (I), (ii) the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital corresponds to the electron affinity (A), and (iii) the energies of the frontier orbitals are constant as a function of their occupation. In agreement with a previous study [N. Sai et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 226403 (2011)], we find that these conditions are met for high values of the exact exchange admixture α and illustrate their importance for the tetrathiafulvalene-tetracyanoquinodimethane complex for which standard density functional theory functionals predict artificial electron transfer. We further assess the performance for atomization energies and weak interaction energies. We find that atomization energies are significantly underestimated compared to PBE or PBE0, whereas the description of weak interaction energies improves significantly if a 1/R6 van der Waals correction scheme is employed.},

  abstract = {Many references exist in the density functional theory (DFT) literature to the chemical potential of the electrons in an atom or a molecule. The origin of this notion has been the identification of the Lagrange multiplier \$\textbackslash mu = \textbackslash partial E/\textbackslash partial N\$ in the Euler-Lagrange variational equation for the ground state density as the chemical potential of the electrons. We first discuss why the Lagrange multiplier in this case is an arbitrary constant and therefore cannot be a physical characteristic of an atom or molecule. The switching of the energy derivative ("chemical potential") from \$-I\$ to \$-A\$ when the electron number crosses the integer, called integer discontinuity or derivative discontinuity, is not physical but only occurs when the nonphysical noninteger electron systems and the corresponding energy and derivative \$\textbackslash partial E/\textbackslash partial N\$ are chosen in a specific discontinuous way. The question is discussed whether in fact the thermodynamical concept of a chemical potential can be defined for the electrons in such few-electron systems as atoms and molecules. The conclusion is that such systems lack important characteristics of thermodynamic systems and do not afford the definition of a chemical potential. They also cannot be considered as analogues of the open systems of thermodynamics that can exchange particles with an environment (a particles bath or other members of a Gibbsian ensemble). Thermodynamical (statistical mechanical) concepts like chemical potential, open systems, grand canonical ensemble etc. are not applicable to a few electron system like an atom or molecule. A number of topics in DFT are critically reviewed in the light of these findings: jumps in the Kohn-Sham potential when crossing an integer number of electrons, the band gap problem, the deviation-from-straight-lines error, the role of ensembles in DFT.},

  abstract = {The flat-plane condition is the union of two exact constraints in electronic structure theory: (i) energetic piecewise linearity with fractional electron removal or addition and (ii) invariant energetics with change in electron spin in a half filled orbital. Semi-local density functional theory (DFT) fails to recover the flat plane, exhibiting convex fractional charge errors (FCE) and concave fractional spin errors (FSE) that are related to delocalization and static correlation errors. We previously showed that DFT+U eliminates FCE but now demonstrate that, like other widely employed corrections (i.e., Hartree-Fock exchange), it worsens FSE. To find an alternative strategy, we examine the shape of semi-local DFT deviations from the exact flat plane and we find this shape to be remarkably consistent across ions and molecules. We introduce the judiciously modified DFT (jmDFT) approach, wherein corrections are constructed from few-parameter, low-order functional forms that fit the shape of semi-local DFT err...},

All the oxygen in the atmosphere is derived from this reaction, and without it the biosphere, as we know it, would not exist. Indeed, the appearance of this catalytic center ∼3 billion years ago gave rise to the “big bang of evolution”. Thus, understanding the structure and functioning of this metal cluster is a major topic in science, and here I discuss it in terms of research that has occurred over the past 12 years dating back to when it was first proposed to be a Mn3CaO4 cubane with the fourth Mn attached to cubane by one of its oxo bridging bonds. Since then, a number of novel properties have emerged for this metalloprotein with implications for its catalytic mechanism and evolutionary origin.},

  abstract = {The biological energy cycle of our planet is driven by photosynthesis whereby sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll and other acces-sory pigments. The excitation energy is then efficiently transferred to a reaction centre where charge separation occurs in a few picoseconds. In the case of photosystem II (PSII), the energy of the charge transfer state is used to split water into oxygen and reducing equivalents. This is accomplished by the relatively low energy content of four photons of visible light. PSII is a large multi-subunit membrane protein complex embedded in the lipid environment of the thylakoid membranes of plants, algae and cyanobacteria. Four high energy electrons, together with four protons (4H +), are used to reduce plastoquinone (PQ), the terminal electron acceptor of PSII, to plastoquinol (PQH 2). PQH 2 passes its reducing equivalents to an electron transfer chain which feeds into photosystem I (PSI) where they gain additional reducing potential from a second light reaction which is necessary to drive CO 2 reduction. The catalytic centre of PSII consists of a cluster of four Mn ions and a Ca 2+ linked by oxo bonds. In addition, there are seven amino acid ligands. In this Article, I discuss the structure of this metal cluster, its stability and the probability that an acid-base (nucleophilic-electrophilic) mechanism catalyses the water splitting reaction on the surface of the metal-cluster. Evidence for this mechanism is presented from studies on water splitting catalysts consisting of organo-complexes of ruthenium and manganese and also by comparison with the enzymology of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH). Finally the relevance of our under-standing of PSII is discussed in terms of artificial photosynthesis with emphasis on inorganic water splitting catalysts as oxygen generating photoelectrodes.},

Bartesaghi et al. achieved a resolution of 2.2 Åfor a 465-kD ligand-bound protein complex using cryo-EM. The density map is detailed enough to show close to 800 water molecules, magnesium and sodium ions, and precise side-chain conformations. These results bring routine use of cryo-EM in rational drug design a step closer.Science, this issue p. 1147Cryo\{\textbackslash textendash\}electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is rapidly emerging as a powerful tool for protein structure determination at high resolution. Here we report the structure of a complex between Escherichia coli β-galactosidase and the cell-permeant inhibitor phenylethyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (PETG), determined by cryo-EM at an average resolution of \textasciitilde 2.2 angstroms (Å). Besides the PETG ligand, we identified densities in the map for \textasciitilde 800 water molecules and for magnesium and sodium ions. Although it is likely that continued advances in detector technology may further enhance resolution, our findings demonstrate that preparation of specimens of adequate quality and intrinsic protein flexibility, rather than imaging or image-processing technologies, now represent the major bottlenecks to routinely achieving resolutions close to 2 Åusing single-particle cryo-EM.}

  abstract = {The Perdew–Zunger (PZ) self-interaction correction (SIC) was designed to correct the one-electron limit of any approximate density functional for the exchange–correlation (xc) energy, while yielding no correction to the exact functional. Unfortunately, it spoils the slowly varying (in space) limits of the uncorrected approximate functionals, where those functionals are right by construction. The right limits can be restored by locally scaling down the energy density of the PZ SIC in many-electron regions, but then a spurious correction to the exact functional would be found unless the self-Hartree and exact self-xc terms of the PZ SIC energy density were expressed in the same gauge. Only the local density approximation satisfies the same-gauge condition for the energy density, which explains why the recent local-scaling SIC is found here to work excellently for atoms and molecules only with this basic approximation and not with the more advanced generalized gradient approximations (GGAs) and meta-GGAs, which lose the Hartree gauge via simplifying integrations by parts. The transformation of energy density that achieves the Hartree gauge for the exact xc functional can also be applied to approximate functionals. Doing so leads to a simple scaled-down self-interaction correction that is typically much more accurate than PZ SIC in tests for many molecular properties (including equilibrium bond lengths). The present work unambiguously shows that the largest errors of PZ SIC applied to standard functionals at three levels of approximation can be removed by restoring their correct slowly varying density limits. It also confirms the relevance of these limits to atoms and molecules.},

For oxidation of carbon monoxide at low temperature, catalysts comprising small ({$<$}5 nm) gold particles supported preferably on an oxide of the first transition series (e.g., TiO2, α-Fe2O3) are needed. Deposition–precipitation and coprecipitation are better methods than impregnation for this purpose and provide the desired intimacy of contact between metal and support.

  abstract = {Orbital-density-dependent functionals, such as the Perdew-Zunger or the Koopmans-compliant functionals, are used to remove unphysical self-interaction energies and to restore missing piece-wise linearity in approximate formulations of density-functional theory (DFT). At variance with functionals of the total density, orbital-density-dependent functionals are typically not invariant with respect to unitary transformations of the occupied states. Such additional degrees of freedom require an extension of established approaches for direct minimization that preserve their numerical robustness and efficiency, and make it possible to apply these advanced electronic-structure functionals to large or complex systems. In this work we adapt the ensemble-DFT algorithm [N. Marzari, D. Vanderbilt, and M. C. Payne, Phys. Rev. Lett. 79, 1337 (1997)PRLTAO0031-900710.1103/PhysRevLett.79.1337] to the case of orbital-density-dependent functionals, partitioning the variational problem into a nested loop of (i) minimizations with respect to unitary transformations at a fixed orbital manifold, that lead to a projected, unitary-covariant functional of the orbitals only that enforces the Pederson condition and (ii) variational optimization of the orbital manifold for this projected functional. We discuss in detail both general and functional-dependent trends and suggest a procedure to efficiently exploit the combination of the different minimization strategies. The overall formulation allows for a stable, robust, and efficient algorithm, yielding great improvements over conventional techniques.},

  abstract = {Although conformational changes are essential for the function of proteins, little is known about their structural dynamics at atomic level resolution. Myoglobin (Mb) is the paradigm to investigate conformational dynamics because it is a simple globular heme protein displaying a photosensitivity of the iron-ligand bond. Upon laser photodissociation of carboxymyoglobin Mb a nonequilibrium population of protein structures is generated that relaxes over a broad time range extending from picoseconds to milliseconds. This process is associated with migration of the ligand to cavities in the matrix and with a reduction in the geminate rebinding rate by several orders of magnitude. Here we report nanosecond time-resolved Laue diffraction data to 1.55-A resolution on a Mb mutant, which depicts the sequence of structural events associated with this extended relaxation. Motions of the distal E-helix, including the mutated residue Gln-64(E7), and of the CD-turn are found to lag significantly (100-300 ns) behind local rearrangements around the heme such as heme tilting, iron motion out of the heme plane, and swinging of the mutated residue Tyr-29(B10), all of which occur promptly ({$<$} or =3 ns). Over the same delayed time range, CO is observed to migrate from a cavity distal to the heme known to bind xenon (called Xe4) to another such cavity proximal to the heme (Xe1). We propose that the extended relaxation of the globin moiety reflects reequilibration among conformational substates known to play an essential role in controlling protein function.}

  abstract = {In Photosystem II (PSII), the Mn4CaO5-cluster of the active site advances through five sequential oxidation states (S0 to S4) before water is oxidized and O2 is generated. Here, we have studied the transition between the low spin (LS) and high spin (HS) configurations of S2 using EPR spectroscopy, quantum chemical calculations using Density Functional Theory (DFT), and time-resolved UV-visible absorption spectroscopy. The EPR experiments show that the equilibrium between S2LS and S2HS is pH dependent, with a pKa\,≈\,8.3 (n\,≈\,4) for the native Mn4CaO5 and pKa\,≈\,7.5 (n\,≈\,1) for Mn4SrO5. The DFT results suggest that exchanging Ca with Sr modifies the electronic structure of several titratable groups within the active site, including groups that are not direct ligands to Ca/Sr, e.g., W1/W2, Asp61, His332 and His337. This is consistent with the complex modification of the pKa upon the Ca/Sr exchange. EPR also showed that NH3 addition reversed the effect of high pH, NH3-S2LS being present at all pH values studied. Absorption spectroscopy indicates that NH3 is no longer bound in the S3TyrZ state, consistent with EPR data showing minor or no NH3-induced modification of S3 and S0. In both Ca-PSII and Sr-PSII, S2HS was capable of advancing to S3 at low temperature (198\,K). This is an experimental demonstration that the S2LS is formed first and advances to S3 via the S2HS state without detectable intermediates. We discuss the nature of the changes occurring in the S2LS to S2HS transition which allow the S2HS to S3 transition to occur below 200\,K. This work also provides a protocol for generating S3 in concentrated samples without the need for saturating flashes.},

We describe the electronic structure of the metallic and both insulating phases of VO2, and propose a distinct mechanism for the gap opening. We show that Mott physics plays an essential role in all phases of VO2: undimerized vanadium atoms undergo classical Mott transition through local moment formation (in the M2 phase), while strong superexchange within V dimers adds significant dynamic intersite correlations, which remove the singularity of self-energy for dimerized V atoms. The resulting transition from rutile to dimerized M1 phase is adiabatically connected to the Peierls-like transition, but is better characterized as the Mott transition in the presence of strong intersite exchange. As a consequence of Mott physics, the gap in the dimerized M1 phase is temperature dependent. The sole increase of electronic temperature collapses the gap, reminiscent of recent experiments.},

First of all, we revisit the reference CCSD(T) ionization potentials for this popular benchmark set and establish a revised set of CCSD(T) results. Then, for all of these 100 molecules, we calculate the HOMO energy within second and third-order perturbation theory (PT2 and PT3), and, GW as post-Hartree-Fock methods. We found GW to be the most accurate of these three approximations for the ionization potential, by far. Going beyond GW by adding more diagrams is a tedious and dangerous activity: We tried to complement GW with second-order exchange (SOX), with second-order screened exchange (SOSEX), with interacting electron-hole pairs (WTDHF), and with a GW density-matrix (γGW). Only the γGW result has a positive impact. Finally using an improved hybrid functional for the non-interacting Green’s function, considering it as a cheap way to approximate self-consistency, the accuracy of the simplest GW approximation improves even more. We conclude that GW is a miracle: Its subtle balance makes GW both accurate and fast.},

Bučko, S. Lebègue, J. Hafner, and J. Ángyán, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 9, 4293 (2013)]. The standard Hirshfeld method uses neutral atoms as a reference, whereas in the iterative Hirshfeld (HI) scheme the fractionally charged atomic reference states are determined self-consistently. We show that the HI method predicts more realistic AIM charges and that the TS/HI approach leads to polarizabilities and C6 dispersion coefficients in ionic or partially ionic systems which are, as expected, larger for anions than for cations (in contrast to the conventional TS method). For crystalline materials, the new algorithm predicts polarizabilities per unit cell in better agreement with the values derived from the Clausius-Mosotti equation. The applicability of the TS/HI method has been tested for a wide variety of molecular and solid-state systems. It is demonstrated that for systems dominated by covalent interactions and/or dispersion forces the TS/HI method leads to the same results as the conventional TS approach. The difference between the TS/HI and TS approaches increases with increasing ionicity. A detailed comparison is presented for isoelectronic series of octet compounds, layered crystals, complex intermetallic compounds, and hydrides, and for crystals built of molecules or containing molecular anions. It is demonstrated that only the TS/HI method leads to accurate results for systems where both electrostatic and dispersion interactions are important, as illustrated for Li-intercalated graphite and for molecular adsorption on the surfaces in ionic solids and in the cavities of zeolites.}

X-ray absorption spectroscopy, pair distribution function analysis, and first-principles calculations of intermediate structures shed light on the mechanism of charge storage in the Li–FeS2 system, with some general principles emerging for charge storage in chalcogenide materials. Focusing on second and later charge/discharge cycles, we find small, disordered domains that locally resemble Fe and Li2S at the end of the first discharge. Upon charge, this is converted to a Li–Fe–S composition whose local structure reve...}

  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) has recently gained attention as a means to develop more accurate exchange-correlation (XC) functionals for density functional theory, but functionals developed thus far need to be improved on several metrics, including accuracy, numerical stability, and transferability across chemical space. In this work, we introduce a set of nonlocal features of the density called the CIDER formalism, which we use to train a Gaussian process model for the exchange energy that obeys the critical uniform scaling rule for exchange. The resulting CIDER exchange functional is significantly more accurate than any semilocal functional tested here, and it has good transferability across main-group molecules. This work therefore serves as an initial step toward more accurate exchange functionals, and it also introduces useful techniques for developing robust, physics-informed XC models via ML.},

Here, we quantify the effects of thermal activation in CsPbBr3 nanocrystals across length scales with atomic-level precision, and we provide a framework for the description of phase transitions therein, beyond the simplistic picture of unit-cell symmetry increase upon heating. The temperature increase significantly enhances the short-range structural distortions of the lead halide framework as a consequence of the phonon anharmonicity, which causes the excess free energy surface to change as a function of temperature. As a result, phase transitions can be rationalized via the soft-mode model, which also describes displacive thermal phase transitions in oxide perovskites. Our findings allow to reconcile temperature-dependent modifications of physical properties, such as changes in the optical band gap, that are incompatible with the perovskite time- and space-average structures.},

The resulting OEP can be identified as the exchange potential of Kohn-Sham density-functional theory. The present work generalizes this OEP approach to treat the correlated case, and shows that the Kohn-Sham exchange-correlation potential is the variationally best local approximation to the exchange-correlation self-energy. This provides a variational derivation of the equation for the exact exchange-correlation potential that was derived by Sham and Schlüter using a density condition. Implications for an approximate physical interpretation of the Kohn-Sham orbitals are discussesd. A correlated generalization of the Sharp-Horton–Krieger-Li-Iafrate [Phys Lett.

  abstract = {The classic density-functional theory (DFT) formalism introduced by Hohenberg, Kohn, and Sham in the mid-1960s, is based upon the idea that the complicated N-electron wavefunction can be replaced with the mathematically simpler 1-electron charge density in electronic struc- ture calculations of the ground stationary state. As such, ordinary DFT is neither able to treat time-dependent (TD) problems nor describe excited electronic states. In 1984, Runge and Gross proved a theorem making TD-DFT formally exact. Information about electronic excited states may be obtained from this theory through the linear response (LR) theory formalism. Begin- ning in the mid-1990s, LR-TD-DFT became increasingly popular for calculating absorption and other spectra of medium- and large-sized molecules. Its ease of use and relatively good accuracy has now brought LR-TD-DFT to the forefront for this type of application. As the number and the diversity of applications of TD-DFT has grown, so too has grown our understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the approximate functionals commonly used for TD-DFT. The objective of this article is to continue where a previous review of TD-DFT in this series [Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 55: 427 (2004)] left off and highlight some of the problems and solutions from the point of view of applied physical chemistry. Since doubly-excited states have a particularly important role to play in bond dissociation and formation in both thermal and photochemistry, particular emphasis will be placed upon the problem of going beyond or around the TD-DFT adiabatic approximation which limits TD-DFT calculations to nominally singly-excited states.

Both Gross–Oliveira–Kohn (GOK) and N-centered ensemble formalisms, which are mathematically very similar and allow for an in-principle-exact description of neutral and charged electronic excitations, respectively, are discussed. Key exact results, for example, the equivalence between the infamous derivative discontinuity problem and the description of weight dependencies in the ensemble exchange-correlation density functional, are highlighted. The variational evaluation of orbital-dependent ensemble Hartree-exchange (Hx) energies is discussed in detail. We show in passing that state-averaging individual exact Hx energies can lead to severe (although solvable) v-representability issues. Finally, we explore the possibility of using the concept of density-driven correlation, which has been introduced recently and does not exist in regular ground-state DFT, for improving state-of-the-art correlation density-functional approximations for ensembles. The present review reflects the efforts of a growing community to turn ensemble DFT into a rigorous and reliable low-cost computational method for excited states. We hope that, in the near future, this contribution will stimulate new formal and practical developments in the field.},

  abstract = {© Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society. The catalytic cycle of photosynthetic water oxidation occurs at the Mn 4 CaO 5 oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) of photosystem II. Extensive spectroscopic data have been collected on the intermediates, especially the S 2 (Kok) state, although the proton and electron inventories (Mn oxidation states) are still uncertain. The "high oxidation" paradigm assigns S 2 Mn oxidation level (III, IV, IV, IV) or (IV, IV, IV, III), whereas a "low oxidation" paradigm posits two additional electrons. Here, we investigate the geometric (X-ray diffraction, extended X-ray absorption fine structure) and spectroscopic (electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR)) properties of the S 2 state using quantum chemical density functional theory calculations, focusing on the neglected low paradigm. Two interconvertible electronic spin configurations are predicted as ground states, producing multiline (S = 1/2) and broad (S = 5/2) EPR signals in the low paradigm oxidation state (III, IV, III, III) and with W2 as OH - and O5 as OH - . They have "open" (S = 5/2) and "closed" (S = 1/2) Mn 3 CaO 4 -cubane geometries. Other energetically accessible isomers with ground spin states 1/2, 7/2, 9/2, or 11/2 can be obtained through perturbations of hydrogen-bonding networks (e.g., H + from His337 to O3 or W2), consistent with experimental observations. Conformers with the low oxidation state configuration (III, IV, IV, II) also become energetically accessible when the protonation states are O5 (OH - ), W2 (H 2 O), and neutral His337. The configuration with (III, IV, III, III) agrees well with earlier low-temperature EPR and ENDOR interpretations, whereas the Mn II -containing configuration agrees partially with recent ENDOR data. However, the low oxidation paradigm does not yield isotropic ligand hyperfine interactions in good agreement with observed values. We conclude that the low Mn oxidation state proposal for the OEC can closely fit most of the available structural and electronic data for S 2 at accessible energies.},

The relative energies and orbital energies are not changed appreciably by the introduction of a relativistic correction.

The major features of JARVIS are: JARVIS-DFT, JARVIS-FF, JARVIS-ML, and JARVIS-tools. To date, JARVIS consists of ≈40,000 materials and ≈1 million calculated properties in JARVIS-DFT, ≈500 materials and ≈110 force-fields in JARVIS-FF, and ≈25 ML models for material-property predictions in JARVIS-ML, all of which are continuously expanding. JARVIS-tools provides scripts and workflows for running and analyzing various simulations. We compare our computational data to experiments or high-fidelity computational methods wherever applicable to evaluate error/uncertainty in predictions. In addition to the existing workflows, the infrastructure can support a wide variety of other technologically important applications as part of the data-driven materials design paradigm.

  abstract = {Nature's water splitting cofactor passes through a series of catalytic intermediates (S0-S4) before O-O bond formation and O2 release. In the second last transition (S2 to S3) cofactor oxidation is coupled to water molecule binding to Mn1. It is this activated, water-enriched all MnIV form of the cofactor that goes on to form the O-O bond, after the next light-induced oxidation to S4 How cofactor activation proceeds remains an open question. Here, we report a so far not described intermediate (S3') in which cofactor oxidation has occurred without water insertion. This intermediate can be trapped in a significant fraction of centers ({$>$}50\%) in (i) chemical-modified cofactors in which Ca2+ is exchanged with Sr2+; the Mn4O5Sr cofactor remains active, but the S2-S3 and S3-S0 transitions are slower than for the Mn4O5Ca cofactor; and (ii) upon addition of 3\% vol/vol methanol; methanol is thought to act as a substrate water analog. The S3' electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signal is significantly broader than the untreated S3 signal (2.5 T vs. 1.5 T), indicating the cofactor still contains a 5-coordinate Mn ion, as seen in the preceding S2 state. Magnetic double resonance data extend these findings revealing the electronic connectivity of the S3' cofactor is similar to the high spin form of the preceding S2 state, which contains a cuboidal Mn3O4Ca unit tethered to an external, 5-coordinate Mn ion (Mn4). These results demonstrate that cofactor oxidation regulates water molecule insertion via binding to Mn4. The interaction of ammonia with the cofactor is also discussed.},

Their electronic structure, often characterized by high spin-polarized metal sites, is a challenge for theoretical chemists because of their high degree of dynamical and static correlation. Static correlation is necessary both for the appropriate description of the metal-ligand bonding and for a correct description of the multi-determinant character arising from the magnetic interactions between spin centers. Density functional theory is usually applied using a single-determinant broken-symmetry state which is lacking the correct spin symmetry when the ground state has total low-spin character. To alleviate this drawback we use the extended broken symmetry (EBS) approach to derive approximate ground state energies and, for the first time, forces for the correctly symmetric ground state o...}

In this work we focus on two representatives of a well known family of cathode materials for Li-ion batteries, namely the orthorhombic LiMPO\$\_4\$ olivines (M = Fe, Mn). We show that extended Hubbard functionals with on-site (\$U\$) and inter-site (\$V\$) interactions (so called DFT+U+V) can predict the relative stability of different phases and the overall average voltage of the battery with remarkable accuracy. We find, in particular, that the inclusion of inter-site interactions in the corrective Hamiltonian improves considerably the prediction of thermodynamic quantities when electronic localization occurs in presence of significant interatomic hybridization (as is the case for the Mn compound), and that the self-consistent evaluation of the effective interaction parameters as material- and ground-state-dependent quantities, allows the prediction of energy differences between different phases and concentrations.},

Formulas for the energy derivatives with respect to number of electrons are derived, which clarify the role of optimized effective potentials in prediction of the band gap. Calculations with a recent functional that has much improved behavior for fractional charges give a good prediction of the energy gap and also εHOMO -I for finite systems.

Such fractional-spin states are shown to be ensembles of degenerate ground states with normal spins. It is proven here that the energy of the exact functional for fractional-spin states is a constant, equal to the energy of the comprising degenerate pure-spin states. Dramatic deviations from this exact constancy condition exist with all approximate functionals, leading to large static correlation errors for strongly correlated systems, such as chemical bond dissociation and band structure of Mott insulators. This is demonstrated with numerical calculations for several molecular systems. Approximating the constancy behavior for fractional spins should be a major aim in functional constructions and should open the frontier for density functional theory to describe strongly correlated systems. The key results are also shown to apply in reduced density-matrix functional theory.},

We confirm both the hydrogen-bonding nature of the discrimination effect (3.6 kcal/mol) and assumptions that the relative strain energy stored in the protein is low (less than 1 kcal/mol).

  abstract = {Electronic-structure functionals that include screening effects, such as Hubbard or Koopmans' functionals, are required to describe the response of a system to the fractional addition or removal of an electron from an orbital or a manifold. Here, we present a general method to incorporate screening based on linear-response theory, and we apply it to the case of orbital-by-orbital screening of Koopmans' functionals. We illustrate the importance of such generalization when dealing with challenging systems containing orbitals with very different chemical character, also highlighting the simple dependence of the screening on the localization of the orbitals. We choose a set of 46 transition-metal complexes for which experimental data and accurate many-body perturbation theory calculations are available. When compared to experiment, results for ionization potentials show a very good performance, with a mean absolute error of 0.2 eV, comparable to the most accurate many-body perturbation theory approaches. These results reiterate the role of Koopmans-compliant functionals as simple and accurate quasiparticle approximations to the exact spectral functional, bypassing diagrammatic expansions and relying only on the physics of the local density or generalized-gradient approximation.},

  abstract = {Photosystem II (PSII), a multisubunit pigment-protein supercomplex found in cyanobacteria, algae, and plants, catalyzes a unique reaction in nature: the light-driven oxidation of water. Remarkable recent advances in the structural analysis of PSII now give a detailed picture of the static supercomplex on the molecular level. These data provide a solid foundation for future functional studies, in particular the mechanism of water oxidation and oxygen release. The catalytic core of the PSII is a tetramanganese-calcium cluster (Mn₄O₅Ca), commonly referred to as the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC). The function of the OEC rests on its ability to cycle through five metastable states (Si, i = 0-4), transiently storing four oxidizing equivalents, and in so doing, facilitates the four electron water splitting reaction. While the latest crystallographic model of PSII gives an atomic picture of the OEC, the exact connectivity within the inorganic core and the S-state(s) that the X-ray model represents remain uncertain. In this Account, we describe our joint experimental and theoretical efforts to eliminate these ambiguities by combining the X-ray data with spectroscopic constraints and introducing computational modeling. We are developing quantum chemical methods to predict electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) parameters for transition metal clusters, especially focusing on spin-projection approaches combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We aim to resolve the geometric and electronic structures of all S-states, correlating their structural features with spectroscopic observations to elucidate reactivity. The sequence of manganese oxidations and concomitant charge compensation events via proton transfer allow us to rationalize the multielectron S-state cycle. EPR spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations provides a unique window into the tetramangenese complex, in particular its protonation states and metal ligand sphere evolution, far beyond the scope of static techniques such as X-ray crystallography. This approach has led, for example, to a detailed understanding of the EPR signals in the S₂-state of the OEC in terms of two interconvertible, isoenergetic structures. These two structures differ in their valence distribution and spin multiplicity, which has important consequences for substrate binding and may explain its low barrier exchange with solvent water. New experimental techniques and innovative sample preparations are beginning to unravel the complex sequence of substrate uptake/inclusion, which is coupled to proton release. The introduction of specific site perturbations, such as replacing Ca²⁺ with Sr²⁺, provides discrete information about the ligand environment of the individual Mn ions. In this way, we have identified a potential open coordination site for one Mn center, which may serve as a substrate binding site in the higher S-states, such as S₃ and S₄. In addition, we can now monitor the binding of the substrate water in the lower S-states (S₁ and S₂) using new EPR-detected NMR spectroscopies. These studies provided the first evidence that one of the substrates is subsumed into the complex itself and forms an oxo-bridge between two Mn ions. This result places important new restrictions on the mechanism of O-O bond formation. These new insights from nature's water splitting catalyst provide important criteria for the rational design of bioinspired synthetic catalysts.},

In a recent report (Cox et al. 2014 Science 345, 804–808 (doi:10.1126/science.1254910)), we showed that the catalyst—a Mn 4 O 5 Ca cofactor—converts into an 'activated' form immediately prior to the O–O bond formation step. This activated state, which represents an all Mn IV complex, is similar to the structure observed by X-ray crystallogra-phy but requires the coordination of an additional water molecule. Such a structure locates two oxygens, both derived from water, in close proximity, which probably come together to form the product O 2 molecule. We speculate that formation of the activated catalyst state requires inherent structural flexi-bility. These features represent new design criteria for the development of biomimetic and bioinspired model systems for water splitting catalysts using first-row transition metals with the aim of delivering globally deployable artificial photosynthesis technologies.},

Freely dissolved in the hemolymph, they are multi-subunit proteins that contain many copies of the active site, a copper atom pair that reversibly binds oxygen. Octopus hemocyanin is composed of ten subunits, each of which contain seven oxygen-binding “functional units”. The carboxyl-terminal 47 kDa functional unit, Odg, is a proteolytic isolate that binds oxygen reversibly while exhibiting slight Bohr and magnesium ion effects. In this work we present the X-ray structure determination and analysis of Odg at 2.3 Å resolution. Odg has two structural domains: a largely α-helical copper binding domain, and a five-stranded anti-parallel β-sandwich with the jelly roll topology found in many viruses. Six histidine residues ligate the copper atoms, one of which is involved in a thioether bridge. The results show that the hemocyanin from the mollusc and that from the arthropod have distinct tertiary folds in addition to the long recognized differences in their quaternary structures. Nonetheless, a comparison of Octopus and horseshoe crab hemocyanin reveals a similar active site, in a striking example of perhaps both convergent and divergent evolution.}

B, 2010, 82, 115121] is apt for describing donor and acceptor levels for a wide variety of organic molecules, clusters, and oligomers within a few tenths of an electron-volt relative to experiment, which is comparable to the predictive performance of many-body perturbation theory methods at a fraction of the computational cost. © the Owner Societies 2013.},

  abstract = {Obtaining a precise theoretical description of the spectral properties of liquid water poses challenges for both molecular dynamics (MD) and electronic structure methods. The lower computational cost of the Koopmans-compliant functionals with respect to Green’s function methods allows the simulations of many MD trajectories, with a description close to the state-of-art quasi-particle self-consistent GW plus vertex corrections method (QSGW + fxc). Thus, we explore water spectral properties when different MD approaches are used, ranging from classical MD to first-principles MD, and including nuclear quantum effects. We have observed that different MD approaches lead to up to 1 eV change in the average band gap; thus, we focused on the band gap dependence with the geometrical properties of a system to explain such spread. We have evaluated the changes in the band gap due to variations in the intramolecular O–H bond distance and HOH angle, as well as the intermolecular hydrogen bond O···O distance and the OHO angles. We have observed that the dominant contribution comes from the O–H bond length; the O···O distance plays a secondary role, and the other geometrical properties do not significantly influence the gap. Furthermore, we analyze the electronic density of states (DOS), where the KIPZ functional shows good agreement with the DOS obtained with state-of-art approaches employing quasi-particle self-consistent GW plus vertex corrections. The O–H bond length also significantly influences the DOS. When nuclear quantum effects are considered, broadening of the peaks driven by the broader distribution of the O–H bond lengths is observed, leading to a closer agreement with the experimental photoemission spectra.},

  title = {Identifying Carboxylate Ligand Vibrational Modes in Photosystem {{II}} with {{QM}}/{{MM}} Methods},
  author = {Debus, Richard J},
  abstract = {The light-driven oxidation of water in photosystem II (PSII) produces nearly all of the molecular oxygen on Earth and drives the production of nearly all of Earth's biomass. Determining the mechanism of O 2 formation in PSII is one of the hottest topics in photosynthesis and has stimulated much interest in the development of artificial photosynthesis. The catalytic water-oxidizing center (WOC) consists of a Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster, nearby amino acid residues, and numerous surrounding water molecules (Fig. 1). Rapid progress in understanding the mechanism of O 2 formation has been made in the last 5 years because of developments in crystallography (e.g., the development of free electron laser sources) and the interplay between new structural information, com-putational studies, and advanced biophysical methods such as pulsed EPR spectroscopy, X-ray absorbance spectroscopy, and membrane inlet mass spectrometry (1–4). FTIR spectroscopy is an additional biophysical method that has the advantage of being sensitive to the amino acid residues and water molecules that sur-round the Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster. However, the interpretation of much of the FTIR literature on PSII has been hampered by an inability to assign spectral features to specific resi-dues or functional groups. In PNAS, Nakamura and Noguchi (5) address this problem by simulating FTIR difference spectra of the WOC in the symmetric car-boxylate stretching region on the basis of quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods. PSII is located in the thylakoid membranes of plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. It is a homodimer in vivo, having a total molecular weight of ∼700 kDa with each monomer containing at least 20 different subunits and nearly 60 organic and inorganic cofactors. The largest membrane-spanning subunits include CP47 (56 kDa), CP43 (52 kDa), D2 (39 kDa), and D1 (38 kDa). The Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster is ligated by six carboxylate groups, one histidine side chain, and four water molecules. The histi-dine residue (H332) and five of the six carboxylate groups (D170, E189, E333, D342, and the C terminus at A344) are from D1, and one (E354) is from CP43. Recent 1.9-and 1.95-Å crystallographic structures of PSII show that the Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster is arranged as a distorted Mn 3 CaO 4 cube that is linked to a fourth " dangling " Mn ion (denoted Mn4) by two oxo bridges (6, 7). Two water molecules (W1 and W2) coordinate to Mn4, and two (W3 and W4) coordinate to the Ca 2+ ion. Networks of hydrogen bonds in the Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster's envi-ronment efficiently transport protons away from the cluster and permit the access of water. Light-induced separations of charge within PSII drive the accumulation of oxidizing equivalents on the Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster. During each catalytic cycle, the cluster accumulates four oxidiz-ing equivalents, cycling through five oxidation states termed S n , where " n " denotes the number of oxidizing Fig. 1. The Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster and its ligation environment from the 1.95-Å X-ray crystallographic structure (7) (Protein Data Bank ID code 4UB6). For clarity, only selected residues are shown.

Strong correlations are caused by either Mott physics that captures the Coulomb repulsion among charges, or Hund physics that aligns the spins in different orbitals. We identify four energy scales marking the onset and the completion of screening in orbital and spin channels. The differences in these scales, which are manifest in the temperature dependence of the local spectrum and of the charge, spin and orbital susceptibilities, provide clear signatures distinguishing Mott and Hund physics. We illustrate these concepts with realistic studies of two archetypal strongly correlated materials, and corroborate the generality of our conclusions with a model Hamiltonian study.},

  abstract = {The general theory of quantum mechanics is now almost complete, the imperfections that still remain being in connection with the exact fitting in of the theory with relativity ideas. These give rise to difficulties only when high-speed particles are involved, and are therefore of no importance in the consideration of atomic and molecular structure and ordinary chemical reactions, in which it is, indeed, usually sufficiently accurate if one neglects relativity variation of mass with velocity and assumes only Coulomb forces between the various electrons and atomic nuclei. The underlying physical laws necessary for the mathematical theory of a large part of physics and the whole of chemistry are thus completely known, and the difficulty is only that the exact application of these laws leads to equations much too complicated to be soluble. It there fore becomes desirable that approximate practical methods of applying quantum mechanics should be developed, which can lead to an explanation of the main features of complex atomic systems without too much computation. Already before the arrival of quantum mechanics there existed a theory of atomic structure, based on Bohr’s ideas of quantised orbits, which was fairly successful in a wide field. To get agreement with experiment it was found necessary to introduce the spin of the electron, giving a doubling in the number of orbits of an electron in an atom. With the help of this spin and Pauli’s exclusion principle, a satisfactory theory of multiplet terms was obtained when one made the additional assumption that the electrons in an atom all set themselves with their spins parallel or antiparallel. If s denoted the magnitude of the resultant spin angular momentum, this s was combined vectorially with the resultant orbital angular momentum l to give a multiplet of multiplicity 2 s + 1. The fact that one had to make this additional assumption was, however, a serious disadvantage, as no theoretical reasons to support it could be given. It seemed to show that there were large forces coupling the spin vectors of the electrons in an atom, much larger forces than could be accounted for as due to the interaction of the magnetic moments of the electrons. The position was thus that there was empirical evidence in favour of these large forces, but that their theoretical nature was quite unknown.},

Solving the Bethe–Salpeter equation (BSE) for electron–hole pairs usually yields accurate predictions of absorption spectra, but it is computationally expensive, especially if thermal averages of spectra computed for multiple configurations are required. We present a method based on machine learning to evaluate a key quantity entering the definition of absorption spectra: the dielectric screening. We show that our approach yields a model for the screening that is transferable between multiple configurations sampled during first principles molecular dynamics simulations; hence it leads to a substantial improvement in the efficiency of calculations of finite temperature spectra. We obtained computational gains of one to two orders of magnitude for systems with 50 to 500 atoms, including liquids, solids, nanostructures, and solid/liquid interfaces. Importantly, the models of dielectric screening derived here may be used not only in the solution of the BSE but also in developing functionals for time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations of homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. Overall, our work provides a strategy to combine machine learning with electronic structure calculations to accelerate first principles simulations of excited-state properties.},

  abstract = {We present an implementation of the \$GW\$ space-time approach that allows cubic-scaling all-electron calculations with standard Gaussian basis sets without exploiting any localization nor sparsity considerations. The independent-electron susceptibility is constructed in a time representation over a non-uniform distribution of real-space locations \$\textbackslash lbrace \{\textbackslash bf r\}\_k \textbackslash rbrace\$ optimized within a separable resolution-of-the-identity framework to reproduce standard Coulomb-fitting calculations with meV accuracy. The compactness of the obtained \$\textbackslash lbrace \{\textbackslash bf r\}\_k \textbackslash rbrace\$ distribution leads to a crossover with the standard Coulomb-fitting scheme for system sizes below a few hundred electrons. The needed analytic continuation follows a recent approach that requires the continuation of the screened Coulomb potential rather than the much more structured self-energy. The present scheme is benchmarked over large molecular sets and scaling properties are demonstrated on a family of defected hexagonal boron-nitride flakes containing up to 6000 electrons.},

  abstract = {To explore the formation of noncollinear magnetic configurations in materials with strongly correlated electrons, we derive a noncollinear LSDA+U model involving only one parameter U, as opposed to the difference between the Hubbard and Stoner parameters U−J. Computing U in the constrained random phase approximation, we investigate noncollinear magnetism of uranium dioxide UO2 and find that the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) stabilizes the 3k ordered magnetic ground state. The estimated SOC strength in UO2 is as large as 0.73 eV per uranium atom, making spin and orbital degrees of freedom virtually inseparable. Using a multipolar pseudospin Hamiltonian, we show how octupolar and dipole-dipole exchange coupling help establish the 3k magnetic ground state with canted ordering of uranium f orbitals. The cooperative Jahn-Teller effect does not appear to play a significant part in stabilizing the noncollinear 3k state, which has the lowest energy even in an undistorted lattice. The choice of parameter U in the LSDA+U model has a notable quantitative effect on the predicted properties of UO2, in particular on the magnetic exchange interaction and, perhaps trivially, on the band gap: The value of U=3.46eV computed fully ab initio delivers the band gap of 2.11 eV in good agreement with experiment, and a balanced account of other pertinent energy scales.},

Our approach is implemented in, but not restricted to, a linear-scaling density functional theory (DFT) framework, opening the path for self-consistent implicit solvent DFT calculations on systems of unprecedented size, which we demonstrate with calculations on a 2615-atom protein-ligand complex.}

  abstract = {The average energy curvature as a function of the particle number is a molecule-specific quantity, which measures the deviation of a given functional from the exact conditions of density functional theory (DFT). Related to the lack of derivative discontinuity in approximate exchange-correlation potentials, the information about the curvature has been successfully used to restore the physical meaning of Kohn-Sham orbital eigenvalues and to develop non-empirical tuning and correction schemes for density functional approximations. In this work, we propose the construction of a machine-learning framework targeting the average energy curvature between the neutral and the radical cation state of thousands of small organic molecules (QM7 database). The applicability of the model is demonstrated in the context of system-specific gamma-tuning of the LC-\$\textbackslash omega\$PBE functional and validated against the molecular first ionization potentials at equation-of-motion (EOM) coupled-cluster references. In addition, we propose a local version of the non-linear regression model and demonstrate its transferability and predictive power by determining the optimal range-separation parameter for two large molecules relevant to the field of hole-transporting materials. Finally, we explore the underlying structure of the QM7 database with the t-SNE dimensionality-reduction algorithm and identify structural and compositional patterns that promote the deviation from the piecewise linearity condition.},

A subsequent single cycle of Fourier refinement reduced the R-factor to 27·6\%. The root-mean-square error in atomic positions, estimated by two independent methods, is 0·40 Å for all atoms. The estimated positional error for all alpha carbons is 0·30 Å, for alpha carbons of internal segments it is 0·23 Å, and for the iron it is 0·10 Å. The distance of the iron atom from the porphyrin plane is 0·60 Å in the α haem and 0·63 Å in the β haem; the distance of the N(ɛ) of the iron-linked histidine from the porphyrin plane is 2·6 Å in the α haem and 2·8 Å in the β haem. These distances assume a planar porphyrin; the resolution is insufficient to distinguish between a planar conformation and a domed one, with a lesser displacement of the iron from the plane of the porphyrin nitrogens. The distance of C(γ) of ValE11 from the ligand site is 3·4 Å in the α haem and 1·8 Å in the β haem, so that the ligand site in the β haem is blocked. A probable salt bridge between Arg FG4(92)α1 and Glu CD2(43)β2 is found in the present structure; as this salt bridge cannot be formed in haemoglobin Chesapeake (Arg FG4α→Leu) it may account for the higher oxygen affinity of the mutant (Gibson \& Nagel, 1974) through its effect on the equilibrium between the oxy and deoxy quaternary structures. Comparison of the structures of human and horse deoxyhaemoglobin indicates that significant differences occur only in the region of the amino terminus and the A helix of the β chain: the positions of the centres of mass of the A helices differ by 1·3 Å and those of the amino terminal valine residue by 4 to 5 Å in the two structures, the separation between the A and E helices being greater in human than in horse deoxyhaemoglobin.},

This scheme, whose implementation is totally uncomplicated and particularly suited for the pseudopotental formalism, dramatically improves the LSDA results for a variety of compounds with a minimal increase of computing cost. © 2003 The American Physical Society.},

By means of electronic structure calculations we have studied the nature of such oxygen vacancy and hydrogen impurity states in the bulk of the anatase polymorph of TiO2. The spin polarized nature of these centers, the localized or delocalized character of the extra electrons, the presence of defect-induced states in the gap, and the polaronic distortion around the defect have been investigated with different theoretical methods: standard density functional theory (DFT) in the generalized-gradient approximation (GGA), GGA+U methods as a function of the U parameter, and two hybrid functionals with different admixtures of Hartree–Fock exchange. The results are found to be strongly dependent on the method used. Only GGA+U or hybrid functionals are able to reproduce the presence of states at about 1 eV below the conduction band, which are ex...},

Both methods lead to thoroughly different results for the relative energy of both isomers. The CASPT2 results reveal an intrinsic stabilization of the [Cu2(μ-O)2]2+ isomer, thus indicating that the presence of a [Cu2(μ-η2:η2-O2)]2+ core in the respiratory proteins must be brought back to the presence of bulky capping ligands and/or to external effects caused by solvents and counterions.

  abstract = {We present in full detail a newly developed formalism enabling density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) calculations from a DFT+U ground state. The implementation includes ultrasoft pseudopotentials and is valid for both insulating and metallic systems. It aims at fully exploiting the versatility of DFPT combined with the low-cost DFT+U functional. This allows us to avoid computationally intensive frozen-phonon calculations when DFT+U is used to eliminate the residual electronic self-interaction from approximate functionals and to capture the localization of valence electrons, e.g., on d or f states. In this way, the effects of electronic localization (possibly due to correlations) are consistently taken into account in the calculation of specific phonon modes, Born effective charges, dielectric tensors, and in quantities requiring well converged sums over many phonon frequencies, as phonon density of states and free energies. The new computational tool is applied to two representative systems, namely CoO, a prototypical transition metal monoxide and LiCoO2, a material employed for the cathode of Li-ion batteries. The results show the effectiveness of our formalism to capture in a quantitatively reliable way the vibrational properties of systems with localized valence electrons.},

Much of this work focuses on the interactions of excitons with the femto-to-picosecond dynamical fluctuations of their environment. However, in experiments these effects can be masked by static disorder of the excited-state energies across ensembles, whose microscopic origins are challenging to predict. Here the excited-state properties of ∼2000 atom clusters of the Fenna–Matthews–Olson complex are simulated using a unique combination of linear-scaling density functional theory and constrained geometric dynamics. While slow, large amplitude protein motion leads to large variations in the Qy transitions of two pigments, we identify pigment–protein correlations that greatly reduce variations in the energy gap across the ensemble, which is consistent with experimental observations of suppressed inhomogeneous dephasing of quantum beats.}

Force fields are typically used for this task but these rely on extensive parameterisation which in cases can lead to limited accuracy and transferability, for example for ligands with unusual functional groups. These limitations can be overcome with first principles calculations with methods such as density functional theory (DFT) but at a much higher computational cost. The use of electrostatic embedding can significantly reduce this cost by representing a portion of the simulated system in terms of highly localised charge distributions. These classical charge distributions are electrostatically coupled with the quantum system and represent the effect of the environment in which the quantum system is embedded.

We compare G0W0 quasiparticle band structures calculated upon local-density approximation (LDA), screened-exchange, HSE03, PBE0, and Hartree-Fock functionals for exchange and correlation (XC) for Si, InN, and ZnO. Furthermore, the HSE03 functional is studied and compared to the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for 15 nonmetallic materials for its use as a starting point in the calculation of quasiparticle excitation energies. For this case, the effects of self-consistency in the GW self-energy are also analyzed. It is shown that the use of a gKS scheme as a starting point for a perturbative quasiparticle correction can improve upon the deficiencies found for LDA or GGA starting points for compounds with shallow d bands. For these solids, the order of the valence and conduction bands is often inverted using local or semilocal approximations for XC, which makes perturbative G0W0 calculations unreliable. The use of a gKS starting point allows for the calculation of fairly accurate band gaps even in these difficult cases, and generally single-shot G0W0 calculations following calculations using the HSE03 functional are very close to experiment.},

The structure unveiled the architecture of the 3.8-MDa supermolecule composed of homologous functional units (FUs), wherein the dimers of FUs hierarchically associated to form the entire cylindrical decamer. Most of the specific inter-FU interactions were localized at narrow regions in the FU dimers, suggesting that rigid FU dimers formed by specific interactions assemble with flexibility. Furthermore, the roles of carbohydrates in assembly and allosteric effect, and conserved sulfur-containing residues in copper incorporation, were revealed.

  abstract = {Hemocyanins are blue copper-containing respiratory proteins in the hemolymph of many arthropods and molluscs. Molluscan hemocyanins are decamers, didecamers, or multidecamers of a 340- to 400-kDa polypeptide subunit containing seven or eight globular functional units (FUs; FU-a to FU-h), each with an oxygen-binding site. The decamers are short 35-nm hollow cylinders, with their lumen narrowed by a collar complex. Our recently published 9-Å cryo-electron microscopy/crystal structure hybrid model of a 3.4-MDa cephalopod hemocyanin decamer [Nautilus pompilius hemocyanin (NpH)] revealed the pathway of the seven-FU subunit (340 kDa), 15 types of inter-FU interface, and an asymmetric collar consisting of five “arcs” (FU-g pairs). We now present a comparable hybrid model of an 8-MDa gastropod hemocyanin didecamer assembled from two asymmetric decamers [isoform keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) 1 of the established immunogen KLH]. Compared to NpH, the KLH1 subunit (400 kDa) is C-terminally elongated by FU-h, which is further extended by a unique tail domain. We have found that the wall-and-arc structure of the KLH1 decamer is very similar to that of NpH. We have traced the subunit pathway and how it continues from KLH1-g to KLH1-h to form an annulus of five “slabs” (FU-h pairs) at one cylinder edge. The 15 types of inter-FU interface detected in NpH are also present in KLH1. Moreover, we have identified one arc/slab interface, two slab/slab interfaces, five slab/wall interfaces, and four decamer/decamer interfaces. The 27 interfaces are described on the basis of two subunit conformers, yielding an asymmetric homodimer. Six protrusions from the cryo-electron microscopy structure per subunit are associated with putative attachment sites for N-linked glycans, indicating a total of 120 sugar trees in KLH1. Also, putative binding sites for divalent cations have been detected. In conclusion, the present 9-Å data on KLH1 confirm and substantially broaden our recent analysis of the smaller cephalopod hemocyanin and essentially solve the gastropod hemocyanin structure.},

  abstract = {Measurable spectra are often derived from contractions of many-body Green's functions. One calculates hence more information than needed. Here we present and illustrate an in principle exact approach to construct effective potentials and kernels for the direct calculation of electronic spectra. In particular, a dynamical but local and real potential yields the spectral function needed to describe photoemission. We discuss for model solids the frequency dependence of this "photoemission potential" stemming from the nonlocality of the corresponding self-energy. © 2007 The American Physical Society.},

This property was common to all the hemocyanins studied (Molluscan and Crustacean hemocyanins). Any possibility that this catalytic property could be due to a catalase incidentally present in the blood or linked to the hemocyanin molecule must be excluded. Not only was iron never found in the protein preparations, but the study of the activity showed several striking differences from that of catalase, among them the pH-activity curve and the action of substrate concentration. Whereas a high concentration of H2O2 inhibits Fe porphyrin catalase activity, it had no effect at all on the catalase activity of hemocyanin. The decomposition of hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by hemocyanin is due to the presence of copper. Removal of the metal from the protein brings loss of activity. The activity is restored to the same level when hemocyanin is reconstituted. Hemocyanin from different sources does not have the same activity as calculated per unit of copper. Hemocyanin from Helix, e.g., with a molecular weight of 8,000,000 and a copper content of 0.25\textbackslash\%, had activity toward H2O2 2.5 times less than that of Octopus hemocyanin which has a molecular weight of 2,800,000 and the same copper content. Moreover, equivalent amounts of inorganic copper had no effect upon H2O2 as demonstrated manometrically.},

On one hand, it appears as a model for quantum dots in a strong confinement regime, and on the other hand, it provides us with a hard test bench for new methods with the “space splitting” arising from the one-dimensional Coulomb potential. Here, we complete the numerous previous studies of the ground state of Hooke’s atom by including the excited states and dynamics, not considered earlier. With the perturbation theory, we reach essentially exact eigenstate energies and wave functions for the strong confinement regime as novel results. We also consider external perturbation induced quantum dynamics in a simple separable case. Finally, we test our novel numerical approach based on real-time path integrals (RTPIs) in reproducing the above. The RTPI turns out to be a straightforward approach with exact account of electronic correlations for solving the eigenstates and dynamics without the conventional restrictions of electronic structure methods.},

  abstract = {In photosystem II (PSII), photosynthetic water oxidation occurs at the tetramanganese-calcium cluster that cycles through light-induced intermediates (S0 - S4) to produce oxygen from two substrate waters. The surrounding hydrogen-bonded amino-acid residues and waters form channels that facilitate proton transfer and substrate water delivery, thereby ensuring efficient water oxidation. The residue D1-S169 lies in the “narrow” channel and forms hydrogen bonds with the Mn4CaO5 cluster via waters W1 and Wx. To probe the role of the narrow channel in substrate-water binding, we studied the D1-S169A mutation. PSII core-complexes isolated from mutant cells exhibit inefficient S-state cycling and delayed oxygen evolution. The S2 state multiline EPR spectrum of D1-S169A PSII core-complexes differed significantly from that of wild-type and FTIR difference spectra showed that the mutation strongly perturbs the extensive network of hydrogen bonds that extends at least from D1-Y161 (YZ) to D1-D61.

Our results are in excellent agreement with experiments where available, and provide predictions where they are not. As a byproduct, we obtain real-space interatomic force constants for these materials, which are useful both for interpolating the dynamical matrices through the Brillouin zone, and as ingredients of approximate calculations for mixed systems such as alloys and microstructures. The possibility of studying these systems using the force constants of the pure materials relies on the so-called mass approximation, B i.e., on neglecting the dependence of the force constants upon composition. The accuracy of such an approximation is tested and found to be very good for cationic intermixing in binary semiconductors, while it is less so for anionic substitutions. The situation is intermediate in the case of elemental semiconductors.},

  abstract = {ABINIT is a package whose main program allows one to find the total energy, charge density, electronic structure and many other properties of systems made of electrons and nuclei, (molecules and periodic solids) within Density Functional Theory (DFT), Many-Body Perturbation Theory (GW approximation and Bethe–Salpeter equation) and Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT). ABINIT also allows to optimize the geometry according to the DFT forces and stresses, to perform molecular dynamics simulations using these forces, and to generate dynamical matrices, Born effective charges and dielectric tensors. The present paper aims to describe the new capabilities of ABINIT that have been developed since 2009. It covers both physical and technical developments inside the ABINIT code, as well as developments provided within the ABINIT package. The developments are described with relevant references, input variables, tests and tutorials. PROGRAM SUMMARY Program title: ABINIT Catalogue identifier: AEEU\_v2\_0 Program summary URL:http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AEEU\_v2\_0.html Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen’s University, Belfast, N. Ireland Licensing provisions: GNU General Public License, version 3 No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 4845789 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 71340403 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: Fortran2003, PERL scripts, Python scripts. Classification: 7.3, 7.8. External routines: (all optional) BigDFT [2], ETSF\_IO [3], libxc [4], NetCDF [5], MPI [6], Wannier90 [7], FFTW [8]. Catalogue identifier of previous version: AEEU\_v1\_0 Journal reference of previous version: Comput. Phys. Comm. 180 (2009) 2582 Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes. The abinit-7.10.5 version is now the up to date stable version of ABINIT Nature of problem: This package has the purpose of computing accurately material and nanostructure properties: electronic structure, bond lengths, bond angles, primitive cell size, cohesive energy, dielectric properties, vibrational properties, elastic properties, optical properties, magnetic properties, non-linear couplings, electronic and vibrational life-times, and others. Solution method: Software application based on Density Functional Theory, Many-Body Perturbation Theory and Dynamical Mean Field Theory, pseudopotentials, with plane waves or wavelets as basis functions. Reasons for new version: Since 2009, the abinit-5.7.4 version of the code has considerably evolved and is not yet up to date. The abinit- 7.10.5 version contains new physical and technical features that allow electronic structure calculations impossible to carry out in the previous versions. Summary of revisions:•new physical features: quantum effects for the nuclei treated by the Path-integral Molecular Dynamics; finding transition states using image dynamics (NEB or string methods); two component DFT for electron-positron annihilation; linear response in a Projector Augmented-Wave approach -PAW-, electron-phonon interactions and temperature dependence of the gap; Bethe Salpeter Equation -BSE-; Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT).•new technical features: development of a PAW approach for a wavelet basis; parallelisation of the code on more than 10,000 processors; new build system.•new features in the ABINIT package: tests; test farm; new tutorials; new pseudopotentials and PAW atomic data tables; GUI and postprocessing tools like the AbiPy and APPA libraries.Running time: It is difficult to answer to the question as the use of ABINIT is very large. On one hand, ABINIT can run on 10,000 processors for hours to perform quantum molecular dynamics on large systems. On the other hand, tutorials for students can be performed on a laptop within a few minutes.

  abstract = {It is shown how to properly construct exchange-correlation (xc) potentials in the Kohn-Sham (KS) formalism of density-functional theory such that physically meaningful KS eigenvalues result. A potential adjustor ΔHxcN- is derived which enables for any approximate functional for the xc energy the construction of a consistent xc potential leading to an eigenvalue of the energetically highest occupied KS orbital equal to the negative of the ionization potential. Together with a second potential adjustor ΔHxcN+ KS band structures can be converted in approximate quasiparticle band structures exhibiting the exact physical instead of the KS band gap. This represents an alternative route to the fundamental quasiparticle band gap, completely within the KS formalism without the need to resort to many-body perturbation theory approaches like the GW method. It is shown that, for any finite system, approximate xc potentials including those in the local density and generalized gradient approximations, in contrast to common belief, always exhibit consistent nonzero discontinuities at integer electron numbers, if constructed properly. Thus the discontinuity of xc potentials is identified as a derived quantity which emerges automatically by properly constructing xc potentials without the need to be specifically incorporated in approximate xc functionals. It is demonstrated that all relevant objects of the ensemble KS formalism, in particular functional derivatives and their discontinuities, can be expressed in terms of quantities readily available in the KS formalism of integer electron numbers within an approach named integer electron ensemble approach (IEEA). Attempts to specifically construct ensemble density functionals are shown to be needless. Taking the known asymptotic behavior of the electron density into account an internal consistency condition for xc potentials is presented which justifies tuning procedures of xc functionals and, furthermore, indicates how asymptotic corrections for xc potentials have to be properly employed.},

  abstract = {A new density functional (DF) of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) type for general chemistry applications termed B97-D is proposed. It is based on Becke's power-series ansatz from 1997 and is explicitly parameterized by including damped atom-pairwise dispersion corrections of the form C(6) x R(-6). A general computational scheme for the parameters used in this correction has been established and parameters for elements up to xenon and a scaling factor for the dispersion part for several common density functionals (BLYP, PBE, TPSS, B3LYP) are reported. The new functional is tested in comparison with other GGAs and the B3LYP hybrid functional on standard thermochemical benchmark sets, for 40 noncovalently bound complexes, including large stacked aromatic molecules and group II element clusters, and for the computation of molecular geometries. Further cross-validation tests were performed for organometallic reactions and other difficult problems for standard functionals. In summary, it is found that B97-D belongs to one of the most accurate general purpose GGAs, reaching, for example for the G97/2 set of heat of formations, a mean absolute deviation of only 3.8 kcal mol(-1). The performance for noncovalently bound systems including many pure van der Waals complexes is exceptionally good, reaching on the average CCSD(T) accuracy. The basic strategy in the development to restrict the density functional description to shorter electron correlation lengths scales and to describe situations with medium to large interatomic distances by damped C(6) x R(-6) terms seems to be very successful, as demonstrated for some notoriously difficult reactions. As an example, for the isomerization of larger branched to linear alkanes, B97-D is the only DF available that yields the right sign for the energy difference. From a practical point of view, the new functional seems to be quite robust and it is thus suggested as an efficient and accurate quantum chemical method for large systems where dispersion forces are of general importance.}

To this end, the unaltered r2SCAN functional is combined with a tailor-made triple-ζ Gaussian atomic orbital basis set as well as with refitted D4 and geometrical counter-poise corrections for London-dispersion and basis set superposition error. The performance of the new method is evaluated for the GMTKN55 database covering large parts of chemical space with about 1500 data points, as well as additional benchmarks for non-covalent interactions, organometallic reactions, and lattice energies of organic molecules and ices, as well as for the adsorption on polar salt and non-polar coinage-metal surfaces. These comprehensive tests reveal a spectacular performance and robustness of r2SCAN-3c: It by far surpasses its predecessor B97-3c at only twice the cost and provides one of the best results of all semi-local density-functional theory (DFT)/QZ methods ever tested for the GMTKN55 database at one-tenth of the cost. Specifically, for reaction and conformational energies as well as non-covalent interactions, it outperforms prominent hybrid-DFT/QZ approaches at two to three orders of magnitude lower cost. Perhaps, the most relevant remaining issue of r2SCAN-3c is self-interaction error (SIE), owing to its mGGA nature. However, SIE is slightly reduced compared to other (m)GGAs, as is demonstrated in two examples. After all, this remarkably efficient and robust method is chosen as our new group default, replacing previous composite DFT and partially even expensive high-level methods in most standard applications for systems with up to several hundreds of atoms.},

  abstract = {The dioxygen formation mechanism of biological water oxidation in nature has long been the focus of argument; many diverse mechanistic hypotheses have been proposed. Based on a recent breakthrough in the resolution of the electronic and structural properties of the oxygen-evolving complex in the S3 state, our density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the open-cubane oxo–oxyl coupling mechanism, whose substrates preferably originate from W2 and O5 in the S2 state, emerges as the best candidate for O–O bond formation in the S4 state. This is justified by the overwhelming energetic superiority of this mechanism over alternative mechanisms in both the isomeric open and closed-cubane forms of the Mn4CaO5 cluster; spin-dependent reactivity rooted in variable magnetic couplings was found to play an essential role. Importantly, this oxygen evolution mechanism is supported by the recent discovery of femtosecond X-ray free electron lasers (XFEL), and the origin of the observed structural changes from the S1 to S3 state has been analyzed. In this view, we corroborate the proposed water binding mechanism during S2–S3 transition and correlate the theoretical models with experimental findings from aspects of substrate selectivity according to water exchange kinetics. This theoretical consequence for native metalloenzymes may serve as a significant guide for improving the design and synthesis of biomimetic materials in the field of photocatalytic water splitting.},

We focus our analysis on the direct estimation of the ionization potential from orbital eigenvalues. Further, we show that the Fermi orbital positions in structurally similar molecules appear to be transferable.},

  abstract = {Transition metal compounds are traditionally considered to be challenging for standard quantum chemistry approximations like coupled cluster (CC) theory, which are usually employed to validate lower level methods like density functional theory (DFT). To explore this issue, we present a database of bond dissociation energies (BDEs) for 74 spin states of 69 diatomic species containing a 3d transition metal atom and a main group element, in the moderately sized def2-SVP basis. The presented BDEs appear to have an (estimated) 3σ error less than 1 kJ/mol relative to the exact solutions to the nonrelativistic Born–Oppenheimer Hamiltonian. These benchmark values were used to assess the performance of a wide range of standard single reference CC models, as the results should be beneficial for understanding the limitations of these models for transition metal systems. We find that interactions between metals and monovalent ligands like hydride and fluoride are well described by CCSDT. Similarly, CCSDTQ appears to ...}

  abstract = {Density Functional Theory has become very widely used to study the electronic structure and related properties of transition metal complexes. Despite the many successes obtained using modern functionals, care is still needed as quite large errors can occur. These can be best understood by taking into consideration how density functional theory works, and how well it performs for the simpler case of main-group compounds. This serves to highlight the critical role of the exchange functional, which describes such varied effects as electron self-interaction, static (or non-dynamic) correlation, and dynamic correlation. A poor balance between these effects can lead to significant errors even for main-group compounds. This is even truer for transition metal compounds. Benchmark data published in the last year suggest that all existing functionals can lead to severe errors for some transition metal compounds. There is a slight trend for systems involving more static correlation to be treated better using second- or third-generation gradient-corrected or kinetic energy density functionals, rather than hybrid functionals. This trend is however quite variable from one type of compound to another. Computed spin-state splittings are highly variable from one functional to another, and this is also diagnostic of differences in the extent of static correlation. The increasing awareness of transition metal compounds by the developers of new exchange–correlation functionals should lead in the medium term to more accurate and hence (even) more useful functionals.}

The ζ exponents (or scale factors) for the atomic orbitals which are optimized for a number of molecules are also shown to be nearly independent of the number of Gaussian functions. A standard set of ζ values for use in molecular calculations is suggested on the basis of this study and is shown to be adequate for the calculation of total and atomization energies, but less appropriate for studies of charge distribution.},

  abstract = {The calculation of the electronic properties of materials is an important task of solid-state theory, albeit particularly difficult if electronic correlations are strong, e.g., in transition metals, their oxides and in f-electron systems. The standard approach to material calculations, the density functional theory in its local density approximation (LDA), incorporates electronic correlations only very rudimentarily and fails if the correlations are strong. Encouraged by the success of dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) in dealing with strongly correlated model Hamiltonians, physicists from the bandstructure and the many-body communities have joined forces and developed a combined LDA + DMFT method recently. Depending on the strength of electronic correlations, this new approach yields a weakly correlated metal as in the LDA, a strongly correlated metal or a Mott insulator. This approach is widely regarded as a breakthrough for electronic structure calculations of strongly correlated materials. We review this LDA + DMFT method and also discuss alternative approaches to employ DMFT in electronic structure calculations, e.g., by replacing the LDA part with the so-called GW approximation. Different methods to solve the DMFT equations are introduced with a focus on those that are suitable for realistic calculations with many orbitals. An overview of the successful application of LDA + DMFT to a wide variety of materials, ranging from Pu and Ce, to Fe and Ni, to numerous transition metal oxides, is given.},

Here, we report highly stable water splitting photoanodes from BiVO4 photoactive cores decorated with CoFe Prussian blue-type electrocatalysts (CoFe-PB). This combination decreases the onset potential of BiVO4 by ∼0.8 V (down to 0.3 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) and increases the photovoltage by 0.45 V. The presence of the catalyst also leads to a remarkable 6-fold enhancement of the photocurrent at 1.23 V versus RHE, while keeping the light-harvesting ability of BiVO4. Structural and mechanistic studies indicate that CoFe-PB effectively acts as a true catalyst on BiVO4. This mechanism, stemming from the adequate alignment of the energy levels, as showed by density functional theory calculations, allows CoFe-PB to outperform all previous catalyst/BiVO4 junctions and, in addition, leads to noteworthy long-term stabilit...},

Blöchl’s projector augmented wave (PAW) approach enables all-electron (AE) calculations with the efficiency and systematic accuracy of plane-wave pseudopotential calculations. Meanwhile, linear-scaling (LS) approaches to density functional theory (DFT) allow for simulation of thousands of atoms in feasible computational effort. This article describes an adaptation of PAW for use in the LS-DFT framework provided by the ONETEP LS-DFT package. ONETEP uses optimisation of the density matrix through in situ -optimised local orbitals rather than the direct calculation of eigenstates as in traditional PAW approaches. The method is shown to be comparably accurate to both PAW and AE approaches and to exhibit improved convergence properties compared to norm-conserving pseudopotential methods.},

Retention of the same globin framework (quaternary structure) in deoxycobaltohemoglobin implies an axial connection with the cobalt protoporphyrin that carries enhanced tension, but a somewhat smaller value of N(epsilon)...P(mu) than the 2.90 A observed in deoxyhemoglobin. Structural constraints imposed on and by the globin in support of tension in the axial linkage are conducive to doming of the entire 24-atom porphine skeleton of the protoporphyrin toward the metal (M) atom. Furthermore, the presence of an odd electron in the 3d(z) (2) orbital of the metal atom is responsible for an easily stretched M-N(epsilon) bond. It then appears that moderate doming of the porphinato core in combination with modest stretch in the Co-N(epsilon) bond can readily lead to an N(epsilon)...P(mu) distance approaching 2.90 A in deoxycobaltohemoglobin and, consequently, to compatibility with Perutz's postulated trigger for the initiation of cooperative interaction of the subunits during the reversible oxygenation of hemoglobin.},

  abstract = {Quantum impurity solvers have a broad range of applications in theoretical studies of strongly correlated electron systems. Especially, they play a key role in dynamical mean-field theory calculations of correlated lattice models and realistic materials. Therefore, the development and implementation of efficient quantum impurity solvers is an important task. In this paper, we present an open source interacting quantum impurity solver toolkit (dubbed iQIST). This package contains several highly optimized quantum impurity solvers which are based on the hybridization expansion continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo algorithm, as well as some essential pre- and post-processing tools. We first introduce the basic principle of continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo algorithm and then discuss the implementation details and optimization strategies. The software framework, major features, and installation procedure for iQIST are also explained. Finally, several simple tutorials are presented in order to demonstrate the usage and power of iQIST.

Ireland Licensing provisions: GNU General Public License, version 3 No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 226270 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 5263144 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: Fortran 2008 and Python. Computer: Desktop PC, laptop, high performance computing cluster. Operating system: Unix, Linux, Mac OS X, Windows. Has the code been vectorized or parallelized?: Yes, it is parallelized by MPI and OpenMP RAM: Depends on the complexity of the problem Classification: 7.3. External routines: BLAS, LAPACK, Latex is required to build the user manual. Nature of problem: Quantum impurity models were originally proposed to describe magnetic impurities in metallic hosts. In these models, the Coulomb interaction acts between electrons occupying the orbitals of the impurity atom. Electrons can hop between the impurity and the host, and in an action formulation, this hopping is described by a time-dependent hybridization function. Nowadays quantum impurity models have a broad range of applications, from the description of heavy fermion systems, and Kondo insulators, to quantum dots in nano-science. They also play an important role as auxiliary problems in dynamical mean-field theory and its diagrammatic extensions [1–3], where an interacting lattice model is mapped onto a quantum impurity model in a self-consistent manner. Thus, the accurate and efficient solution of quantum impurity models becomes an essential task. Solution method: The quantum impurity model can be solved by the numerically exact continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo method, which is the most efficient and powerful impurity solver for finite temperature simulations. In the iQIST software package, we implemented the hybridization expansion version of continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. Both the segment representation and general matrix formalism are supported. The key idea of this algorithm is to expand the partition function diagrammatically in powers of the impurity-bath hybridization, and to stochastically sample these diagrams to all relevant orders using the Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm. For a detailed review of the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo algorithms, please refer to [4]. Running time: Depends on the complexity of the problem. The sample run supplied in the distribution takes about 1.5 minutes. References: [1] A. Georges, G. Kotliar, W. Krauth, and M. J. Rozenberg, Rev. Mod. Phys. 68, 13 (1996) [2] G. Kotliar, S. Y.

  abstract = {The conventional linear response overestimates the U in DFT+U calculations for solids with fully occupied orbitals. Here, we demonstrate that the challenge arises from the incomplete cancellation of the electron–electron Coulomb repulsion energy under external perturbation. We applied the second charge response, denoted as the “pseudo-charge” model, to offset such residue effects. Counteracting between these two charge response-induced Coulomb potentials, the U parameters are self-consistently obtained by fulfilling the conditions for minimizing the non-Koopmans energy. Moreover, the pseudo-charge-induced repulsive potential shows a screening behavior related to the orbital occupation and is potentially in compliance with the screened exact exchange–correlation of electrons. The resultant U parameters are self-consistent solutions for improved band structure calculations by the DFT+U method. This work extends the validity of the linear response method to both partially and fully occupied orbitals and gives a reference for estimating the Hubbard U parameter prior to other advanced methods. The U parameters were determined in a transferability test using both PBE and hybrid density functional methods, and the results showed that this method is independent of the functional. The electronic structures determined from the hybrid-DFT+Uhybrid approach are provided. Comparisons are also made with the recently developed self-consistent hybrid-DFT+Uw method.},

Our results demonstrate how important the dynamic behavior of surrounding water molecules is in mediating critical chemical transformations such as binding and deprotonation of substrates and hydration of the catalytic site and identify a strong coupling of water-chain relocation near the redox-active tyrosine residue Tyr161 (TyrZ) with oxidation of the Mn4CaO5 cluster by TyrZ(•+). The oxidation reaction is further promoted when the catalytic site is more solvated by water. These results indicate the importance of surrounding water molecules in biological catalysts as they ultimately lead to effective catalytic function and/or favorable electron-transfer dynamics.},

For a chosen 340-atom model, 1 stable and 11 metastable intermediates have been identified within the range of 13 kcal mol?1 that differ in protonation, charge, spin, and conformational states. The results imply that reversible interconversion of these intermediates gives rise to dynamic equilibria that involve processes with relocations of protons and electrons residing in the Mn4CaO5 cluster, as well as bound water ligands, with concomitant large changes in the cluster geometry. Such proton tautomerism and redox isomerism are responsible for reversible activation/deactivation processes of substrate oxygen species, through which Mn?O and O?O bonds are transiently ruptured and formed. These results may allow for a tentative interpretation of kinetic data on substrate water exchange on the order of seconds at room temperature, as measured by time-resolved mass spectrometry. The reliability of the hybrid DFT method for the multielectron redox reaction in such an intricate system is also addressed.},

Understanding the roles of heterogeneity in each S-state, as identified recently by the EPR spectroscopy, is very important to gain a complete description of the catalytic mechanism. We performed herein hybrid DFT calculations within the broken-symmetry formalism and associated analyses of Heisenberg spin models to study the electronic and spin structures of various isomeric structural motifs (hydroxo–oxo, oxyl–oxo, peroxo, and superoxo species) in the S3 state. Our extensive study reveals several factors that affect the spin ground state: (1) (formal) Mn oxidation state; (2) metal–ligand covalency; (3) coordination geometry; and (4) structural change of the Mn cluster induced by alternations in Mn···Mn distances. Some combination of these effects could selectively stabilize/destabilize some spin states. We found that the high spin state (Stotal = 6) of the oxyl–oxo species can be causative for cat...}

To this end we devise an ideal scanning tunneling microscope (STM) setup and employ the recently proposed steady-state DFT formalism (i-DFT) which allows one to calculate the steady current through a nanoscopic region coupled to two biased electrodes. In our setup, one of the electrodes serves as a probe (“STM tip”), which is weakly coupled to the system we want to measure. In the ideal STM limit of vanishing coupling to the tip, the system is restored to quasi-equilibrium and the normalized differential conductance yields the exact equilibrium many-body spectral function. Calculating this quantity from i-DFT, we derive an exact relation expressing the interacting spectral function in terms of the Kohn–Sham one. As illustrative examples, we apply our scheme to calculate the spectral functions of two nontrivial model systems, namely the single Anderson impurity model and the Constant Interaction Model.},

  abstract = {First-principles modeling of systems with localized d states is currently a great challenge in condensed-matter physics. Density-functional theory in the standard local-density approximation (LDA) proves to be problematic. This can be partly overcome by including local Hubbard U corrections (LDA+U) but itinerant states are still treated on the LDA level. Many-body perturbation theory in the GW approach offers both a quasiparticle perspective (appropriate for itinerant states) and an exact treatment of exchange (appropriate for localized states), and is therefore promising for these systems. LDA+U has previously been viewed as an approximate GW scheme. We present here a derivation that is simpler and more general, starting from the static Coulomb-hole and screened exchange approximation to the GW self-energy. Following our previous work for f -electron systems we conduct a systematic investigation of the GW method based on LDA+U (GW@LDA+U), as implemented in our recently developed all-electron GW code FHI-gap (Green's function with augmented plane waves) for a series of prototypical d -electron systems: (1) ScN with empty d states, (2) ZnS with semicore d states, and (3) late transition-metal oxides (MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO) with partially occupied d states. We show that for ZnS and ScN, the GW band gaps only weakly depend on U but for the other transition-metal oxides the dependence on U is as strong as in LDA+U. These different trends can be understood in terms of changes in the hybridization and screening. Our work demonstrates that GW@LDA+U with "physical" values of U provides a balanced and accurate description of both localized and itinerant states. © 2010 The American Physical Society.},

In this paper, we review methods for generating PAW data files and for evaluating their accuracy, transferability, and numerical efficiency in simulations of bulk solids. We have developed a new set of PAW atomic data files for most of the stable elements in the periodic table. These files are provided in a standard XML format for use in any PAW electronic structure code. The new dataset performs well as measured by the “Δ” evaluation criterion introduced by Lejaeghere et al.

  abstract = {Cyanobacteria and plants carry out oxygenic photosynthesis. They use water to generate the atmospheric oxygen we breathe and carbon dioxide to produce the biomass serving as food, feed, fibre and fuel. This paper scans the emergence of structural and mechanistic understanding of oxygen evolution over the past 50 years. It reviews speculative concepts and the stepped insight provided by novel experimental and theoretical techniques. Driven by sunlight photosystem II oxidizes the catalyst of water oxidation, a hetero-metallic Mn 4 CaO 5 (H 2 O) 4 cluster. Mn 3 Ca are arranged in cubanoid and one Mn dangles out. By accumulation of four oxidizing equivalents before initiating dioxygen formation it matches the four-electron chemistry from water to dioxygen to the one-electron chemistry of the photo-sensitizer. Potentially harmful intermediates are thereby occluded in space and time. Kinetic signatures of the catalytic cluster and its partners in the photo-reaction centre have been resolved, in the frequency domain ranging from acoustic waves via infra-red to X-ray radiation, and in the time domain from nano- to milli-seconds. X-ray structures to a resolution of 1.9~Å are available. Even time resolved X-ray structures have been obtained by clocking the reaction cycle by flashes of light and diffraction with femtosecond X-ray pulses. The terminal reaction cascade from two molecules of water to dioxygen involves the transfer of four electrons, two protons, one dioxygen and one water. A rigorous mechanistic analysis is challenging because of the kinetic enslaving at millisecond duration of six partial reactions (4e − , 1H + , 1O 2 ). For the time being a peroxide-intermediate in the reaction cascade to dioxygen has been in focus, both experimentally and by quantum chemistry. Homo sapiens has relied on burning the products of oxygenic photosynthesis, recent and fossil. Mankind's total energy consumption amounts to almost one-fourth of the global photosynthetic productivity. If the average power consumption equalled one of those nations with the highest consumption per capita it was four times greater and matched the total productivity. It is obvious that biomass should be harvested for food, feed, fibre and platform chemicals rather than for fuel.}

However, it remains unanswered whether the reactions efficiently proceed throughout the S-state cycle retaining the native structures of the intermediates in PSII crystals. We investigated the water oxidation reactions in the PSII microcrystals using flash-induced Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) difference spectroscopy. In comparison with the FTIR spectra in solution, it was shown that all of the metastable intermediates in the microcrystals retained their native structures, and the efficiencies of the S-state transitions remained relatively high, although those of the S2 → S3 and S3 → S0 transitions were slightly lowered possibly due to some restriction of water movem...},

Each of them contains a reaction centre that is surrounded by light-harvesting antennae, which absorb the light and transfer the excitation energy to the reaction centre where electron transfer reactions are driven. Here we report a critical test for two contrasting models of light harvesting by photosystem II cores, known as the trap-limited and the transfer-to-the trap-limited model. Oriented single crystals of photosystem II core complexes of Synechococcus elongatus are excited by polarized visible light and the transient absorption is probed with polarized light in the infrared. The dichroic amplitudes resulting from photoselection are maintained on the 60ps timescale that corresponds to the dominant energy transfer process providing compelling evidence for the transfer-to-the-trap limitation of the overall light-harvesting process. This finding has functional implications for the quenching of excited states allowing plants to survive under high light intensities. 1},

Here we demonstrate proton releases, dioxygen formation, and substrate water incorporation in response to Mn4CaO5 oxidation in the protein environment, using a quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical approach and molecular dynamics simulations. In S2, H2O at the W1 site forms a low-barrier H-bond with D1-Asp61. In the S2-to-S3 transition, oxidation of OW1H– to OW1•–, concerted proton transfer from OW1H– to D1-Asp61, and binding of a water molecule Wn-W1 at OW1•– are observed. In S4, W n -W1 facilitates oxo-oxyl radical coupling between OW1•– and corner μ-oxo O4. Deprotonation via D1-Asp61 leads to formation of OW1=O4. As OW1=O4 moves away from Mn, H2O at W539 is incorporated into the vacant O4 site of the O2-evolved Mn4CaO4 cluster, forming a μ-oxo bridge (Mn3–OW539–Mn4) in an exergonic process. Simultaneously, Wn-W1 is incorporated as W1, recovering the Mn4CaO5 cluster.},

The model comprises four (meta)stable intermediates (S0, S1, S2 and S3) and one transient S4 state, which precedes dioxygen formation occurring in a concerted reaction from two water-derived oxygens bound at an oxo-bridged tetra manganese calcium (Mn4CaO5) cluster in the oxygen-evolving complex3-7. This reaction is coupled to the two-step reduction and protonation of the mobile plastoquinone QB at the acceptor side of PSII. Here, using serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography and simultaneous X-ray emission spectroscopy with multi-flash visible laser excitation at room temperature, we visualize all (meta)stable states of Kok's cycle as high-resolution structures (2.04-2.08 Å). In addition, we report structures of two transient states at 150 and 400 µs, revealing notable structural changes including the binding of one additional 'water', Ox, during the S2→S3 state transition. Our results suggest that one water ligand to calcium (W3) is directly involved in substrate delivery. The binding of the additional oxygen Ox in the S3 state between Ca and Mn1 supports O-O bond formation mechanisms involving O5 as one substrate, where Ox is either the other substrate oxygen or is perfectly positioned to refill the O5 position during O2 release. Thus, our results exclude peroxo-bond formation in the S3 state, and the nucleophilic attack of W3 onto W2 is unlikely.},

  abstract = {The O2-producing Mn4CaO5 catalyst in photosystem II oxidizes two water molecules (substrate) to produce one O2 molecule. Considerable evidence supports the identification of one of the two substrate waters as the Mn4CaO5 cluster’s oxo bridge known as O5. The identity of the second substrate water molecule is less clear. In one set of models, the second substrate is the Mn-bound water molecule known as W2. In another set of models, the second substrate is the Ca2+-bound water molecule known as W3. In all of these models, a deprotonated form of the second substrate moves to a position next to O5 during the catalytic step immediately prior to O–O bond formation. In this study, FTIR difference spectroscopy was employed to identify the vibrational modes of hydrogen-bonded water molecules that are altered by the substitution of Sr2+ for Ca2+. Our data show that the substitution substantially altered the vibrational modes of only a single water molecule: the water molecule whose D-O–D bending mode is eliminated ...},

However, commonly used approximate density functionals produce total energies that do not exhibit this piecewise-linear behavior. As a result, the ionization potential theorem, equating the highest occupied eigenvalue with the ionization potential, is grossly disobeyed. Here, we show that, contrary to conventional wisdom, most of the required piecewise linearity of an arbitrary approximate density functional can be restored by careful consideration of the ensemble generalization of density-functional theory. Furthermore, the resulting formulation introduces the desired derivative discontinuity to any approximate exchange-correlation functional, even one that is explicitly density dependent. This opens the door to calculations of the ionization potential and electron affinity, even without explicit electron removal or addition. All these advances are achieved while neither introducing empiricism nor changing the underlying functional form. The power of the approach is demonstrated on benchmark systems using the local density approximation as an illustrative example.},

Unfortunately, the fundamental gap is not generally equal to the Kohn-Sham gap of density functional theory (DFT), even in principle. The two gaps differ precisely by the derivative discontinuity, namely, an abrupt change in slope of the exchange-correlation energy as a function of electron number, expected across an integer-electron point. Popular approximate functionals are thought to be devoid of a derivative discontinuity, strongly compromising their performance for prediction of spectroscopic properties. Here we show that, in fact, all exchange-correlation functionals possess a derivative discontinuity, which arises naturally from the application of ensemble considerations within DFT, without any empiricism. This derivative discontinuity can be expressed in closed form using only quantities obtained in the course of a standard DFT calculation of the neutral system.

However, the development of a functional which can serve the two purposes simultaneously is a long-standing challenge.

  abstract = {Accurately describing excited states within Kohn-Sham (KS) density functional theory (DFT), particularly those which induce ionization and charge transfer, remains a great challenge. Common exchange-correlation (xc) approximations are unreliable for excited states owing, in part, to the absence of a derivative discontinuity in the xc energy (\$\textbackslash Delta\$), which relates a many-electron energy difference to the corresponding KS energy difference. We demonstrate, analytically and numerically, how the relationship between KS and many-electron energies leads to the step structures observed in the exact xc potential, in four scenarios: electron addition, molecular dissociation, excitation of a finite system, and charge transfer. We further show that steps in the potential can be obtained also with common xc approximations, as simple as the LDA, when addressed from the ensemble perspective. The article therefore highlights how capturing the relationship between KS and many-electron energies with advanced xc approximations is crucial for accurately calculating excitations, as well as the ground-state density and energy of systems which consist of distinct subsystems.

We further show that steps in the potential can be obtained also with common xc approximations, as simple as the LDA, when addressed from the ensemble perspective. The article therefore highlights how capturing the relationship between KS and many-electron energies with advanced xc approximations is crucial for accurately calculating excitations, as well as the ground-state density and energy of systems which consist of distinct subsystems.},

Different from many former approaches in the theories of information and also in biosemiotics, we will show that the forms of meaning emerge simultaneously (alongside) with information and energy. Hence, information is always meaningful (in a sense to be explicated) rather than its meaning would show up as a later specification of information within social systems only. This perspective taken has two immediate consequences: (1) We follow the GDI as defined by Floridi, though we modify it somehow as to the aspect of truthfulness. (2) We can conceptually solve Capurro’s trilemma. Hence, what we actually do is to follow the strict (i.e. optimistic) line of UTI in the sense of Hofkirchner’s. While doing this, we treat energy and information as two different categorial aspects of one and the same underlying primordial structure.},

  abstract = {The redox potential of synthetic oligonuclear transition metal complexes has been shown to correlate with the Lewis acidity of a redox-inactive cation connected to the redox-active transition metals of the cluster via oxo or hydroxo bridges. Such heterometallic clusters are important cofactors in many metalloenzymes, where it is speculated that the redox-inactive constituent ion of the cluster serves to optimize its redox potential for electron transfer or catalysis. A principal example is the oxygen-evolving complex in photosystem II of natural photosynthesis, a Mn4CaO5 cofactor that oxidizes water into dioxygen, protons and electrons. Calcium is critical for catalytic function, but its precise role is not yet established. In analogy to synthetic complexes it has been suggested that Ca2+ fine-tunes the redox potential of the manganese cluster. Here we evaluate this hypothesis by computing the relative redox potentials of substituted derivatives of the oxygen-evolving complex with the cations Sr2+, Gd3+, Cd2+, Zn2+, Mg2+, Sc3+, Na+ and Y3+ for two sequential transitions of its catalytic cycle. The theoretical approach is validated with a series of experimentally well-characterized Mn3AO4 cubane complexes that are structural mimics of the enzymatic cluster. Our results reproduce perfectly the experimentally observed correlation between the redox potential and the Lewis acidities of redox-inactive cations for the synthetic complexes. However, it is conclusively demonstrated that this correlation does not hold for the oxygen evolving complex. In the enzyme the redox potential of the cluster only responds to the charge of the redox-inactive cations and remains otherwise insensitive to their precise identity, precluding redox-tuning of the metal cluster as a primary role for Ca2+ in biological water oxidation.},

Here, we review spin–structure correlations in Nature’s water-splitting catalyst. The catalytic cycle of the Mn4O5Ca cofactor can be described in terms of spin-dependent reactivity. The lower “inactive” S states of the catalyst, S0 and S1, are characterized by low-spin ground states, SGS = 1/2 and SGS = 0.

  abstract = {Heterogeneity in intermediate catalytic states of the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) of Photosystem II is known from a wide range of experimental and theoretical data, but its potential implications for the mechanism of water oxidation remain unexplored. We delineate the consequences of structural heterogeneity for the final step of the catalytic cycle by tracing the evolution of three spectroscopically relevant and structurally distinct components of the last metastable S3 state to the transient O2-evolving S4 state of the OEC. Using quantum chemical calculations, we show that each S3 isomer leads to a different electronic structure formulation for the active S4 state. Crucially, in addition to previously hypothesized Mn(IV)-oxyl species, we establish for the first time, how a genuine Mn(V)-oxo can be obtained in the catalytically active S4 state: this takes the form of a five-coordinate and locally high-spin (SMn\,=\,1) Mn(V) site. This formulation for the S4 state evolves naturally from a preceding S3-state structural intermediate that contains a quasi-trigonal-bipyramidal Mn(IV) ion. The results strongly suggest that water binding in the S3 state is not prerequisite for reaching the oxygen-evolving S4 state of the complex, supporting the notion that both substrates are preloaded at the beginning of the catalytic cycle. This scenario allows true four-electron metal-centered hole accumulation to precede OO bond formation and hence the latter can proceed via a genuine even-electron mechanism. This can occur as intramolecular nucleophilic coupling of two oxo units synchronously with the binding of a water substrate for the next catalytic cycle.}

Three conditions that must be obeyed by the exact energy functional, but may or may not be obeyed by approximate ones, are often pointed out as important in general and for accurate computation of spectroscopic observables in particular. These are: (1) piecewise linearity as a function of the fractional particle number, (2) freedom from one-electron self-interaction, and (3) for a finite system, the functional derivative with respect to the density results in an asymptotic −1/r potential (in Hartree atomic units), where r is the distance from the system center. In this overview, we explain what these conditions are, what they address, and why each one is of importance for spectroscopy. We then show, using specific examples from the literature, that these three properties are related, but are not equivalent and need to be assessed individually.},

Commonly used quasiparticle approximation for the Green's function and static approximation for the screened interaction are avoided altogether. Using alkali metals Na and K as well as semiconductor Si and wide-gap insulator LiF as examples, it is shown that both the vertex corrections in the polarizability P and in the self-energy are important. Particularly, vertex corrections in with proper treatment of frequency dependence of the screened interaction always reduce calculated bandwidths/band gaps, improving the agreement with experiment. The complexity of the vertex included in P and in can be different. Whereas in the case of polarizability one generally has to solve the Bethe-Salpeter equation for the corresponding vertex function, it is enough (for the materials in this study) to include the vertex of the first order in the self-energy. The calculations with appropriate vertices show remarkable improvement in the calculated bandwidths and band gaps as compared to the self-consistent GW approximation as well as to the self-consistent quasiparticle GW approximation.},

However, the virial of the correlation potential does not yield the correlation energy. We have recently constructed a “hypercorrelated” potential whose virial is the correlation energy. We apply these ideas to a system which contains two interacting electrons in an external harmonic potential, Hooke's atom. This system can be solved analytically for a set of spring constants and numerically for any spring constant. By inverting the Kohn–Sham equations, the exact exchange and correlation potentials can be found. These exact values are compared with several popular approximate functionals, namely local spin density (LSD), Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE), and Becke and Lee–Yang–Parr (BLYP). We illustrate our results for two values of the spring constant. At a moderate value, the density is comparable to the He atom, while for a low spring constant, we explore extremely low densities. © 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

  abstract = {First-principles Hubbard-corrected approximate density-functional theory (DFT+U) is a low-cost, potentially high throughput method of simulating materials, but it has been hampered by empiricism and inconsistent band-gap correction in transition-metal oxides. DFT+U property prediction of non-magnetic systems such as d0 and d10 transition-metal oxides is typically faced with excessively large calculated Hubbard U values, and with difficulty in obtaining acceptable band-gaps and lattice volumes. Meanwhile, Hund's exchange coupling J is an important but often neglected component of DFT+U, and the J parameter has proven challenging to directly calculate by means of linear response. In this work, we provide a revised formula for computing Hund's J using established self-consistent field DFT+U codes. For non-magnetic systems, we introduce a non-approximate technique for calculating U and J simultaneously in such codes, at no additional cost. Using unmodified Quantum ESPRESSO, we assess the resulting values using two different DFT+U functionals incorporating J, namely the widely used DFT+(U-J) and the readily available DFT+U+J. We assess a test set comprising TiO2, ZrO2, HfO2, Cu2O and ZnO, and apply the corrections both to metal and oxygen centered pseudoatomic subspaces. Starting from the PBE functional, we find that DFT+(U-J) is significantly out-performed in band-gap accuracy by DFT+U+J, the RMS band-gap error of which matches that of the hybrid functional HSE06. ZnO, a long-standing challenge case for DFT+U, is addressed by means of Zn 4s instead of Zn 3d correction, in which case the first-principles DFT+U+J band-gap error is half of that reported for HSE06.},

  abstract = {We discuss the analytic and diagrammatic structure of ionization potential (IP) and electron affinity (EA) equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (EOM-CC) theory, in order to put it on equal footing with the prevalent GW approximation. The comparison is most straightforward for the time-ordered one-particle Green's function, and we show that the Green's function calculated by EOM-CC with single and double excitations (EOM-CCSD) includes fewer ring diagrams at higher order than does the GW approximation, due to the former's unbalanced treatment of time-ordering. However, the EOM-CCSD Green's function contains a large number of vertex corrections, including ladder diagrams, mixed ring-ladder diagrams, and exchange diagrams. By including triple excitations, the EOM-CCSDT Green's function includes all diagrams contained in the GW approximation, along with many high-order vertex corrections. In the same language, we discuss a number of common approximations to the EOM-CCSD equations, many of which can be classified as elimination of diagrams. Finally, we present numerical results by calculating the principal charged excitations energies of the molecules contained in the so-called GW100 test set [ J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2015, 11, 5665-5687 ]. We argue that (in molecules) exchange is as important as screening, advocating for a Hartree-Fock reference and second-order exchange in the self-energy.},

  abstract = {Universal variational functionals of densities, first-order density matrices, and natural spin-orbitals are explicitly displayed for variational calculations of ground states of interacting electrons in atoms, molecules, and solids. In all cases, the functionals search for constrained minima. In particular, following Percus [Formula: see text] is identified as the universal functional of Hohenberg and Kohn for the sum of the kinetic and electron-electron repulsion energies of an N-representable trial electron density rho. Q[rho] searches all antisymmetric wavefunctions Psi(rho) which yield the fixed. rho. Q[rho] then delivers that expectation value which is a minimum. Similarly, [Formula: see text] is shown to be the universal functional for the electron-electron repulsion energy of an N-representable trial first-order density matrix gamma, where the actual external potential may be nonlocal as well as local. These universal functions do not require that a trial function for a variational calculation be associated with a ground state of some external potential. Thus, the v-representability problem, which is especially severe for trial first-order density matrices, has been solved. Universal variational functionals in Hartree-Fock and other restricted wavefunction theories are also presented. Finally, natural spin-orbital functional theory is compared with traditional orbital formulations in density functional theory.},

However, achieving this goal with smaller particles of lower symmetry remains challenging. Using a newly developed single electron-counting detector, we confirmed that electron beam-induced motion substantially degrades resolution, and we showed that the combination of rapid readout and nearly noiseless electron counting allow image blurring to be corrected to subpixel accuracy, restoring intrinsic image information to high resolution (Thon rings visible to [sim]3 A). Using this approach, we determined a 3.3-A-resolution structure of an [sim]700-kDa protein with D7 symmetry, the Thermoplasma acidophilum 20S proteasome, showing clear side-chain density. Our method greatly enhances image quality and data acquisition efficiency[mdash]key bottlenecks in applying near-atomic-resolution cryo-EM to a broad range of protein samples.}

It is responsible for a large class of problems in the density functional theory calculations. For an effective and universal alleviation of the delocalization error, we develop a local scaling correction scheme by imposing the Perdew-Parr-Levy- Balduz linearity condition to local regions of a system. Our novel scheme is applicable to various mainstream density functional approximations. It substantially reduces the delocalization error, as exemplified by the significantly improved description of dissociating molecules, transition-state species, and charge-transfer systems. The usefulness of our novel scheme affirms that the explicit treatment of fractional electron distributions is essentially important for reducing the intrinsic delocalization error associated with approximate density functionals.},

Moreover, for semi-local density functionals, we show that the piecewise convexity of the E(N) curve, as stated in the literature, is not generally true for all fractions. By an analysis based on exchange-only local density approximation and careful examination of the E(N) curve, we find for some systems, there exists a very small concave region, corresponding to adding a small fraction of electrons to the integer system, while the remaining E(N) curve is convex. Several numerical examples are provided as verification. Although the E(N) curve is not convex everywhere in these systems, the previous conclusions on the consequence of the delocalization error in the commonly used density functional approximations, in particular, the underestimation of ionization potential, and the overestimation of electron affinity, and other related issues, remain unchanged. This suggests that instead of using the term convexity, a modified and more rigorous description for the delocalization error is that the E(N) curve lies below the straight line segment across the neighboring integer points for these approximate functionals.},

LOSC systematically eliminates the delocalization error in the density functional approximation and is capable of approximating quasiparticle (QP) energies with accuracy similar to or better than GW Green’s function approach and with much less computational cost. The QP energies from LOSC, instead of commonly used G0W0 and evGW, are directly used in BSE. We show that the BSE/LOSC approach greatly outperforms the commonly used BSE/G0W0 approach for predicting excitations with different characters. For the calculations of Truhlar–Gagliardi test set containing valence, charge transfer, and Rydberg excitations, BSE/LOSC with the Tamm–Dancoff approximation provides a comparable accuracy to time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) and BSE/evGW. For the calculations of Stein CT test set and Rydberg excitations of atoms, BSE/LOSC considerably outperforms both BSE/G0W0 and TDDFT approaches with a reduced starting point dependence. BSE/LOSC is, thus, a promising and efficient approach to calculate excitation energies for molecular systems.},

While this system is often regarded as a prototypical multireference case, we treat it with the single reference local-pair natural orbital coupled cluster method and reiterate that the multireference character in this system is very limited. A set of intermediate structures, for the interconversion between the two isomers, is calculated through a relaxed surface scan thus allowing the calculation of an energetic profile that cleanly connects the bis-(μ-oxo) and side-on peroxo minima on the ground-...}

Improving on a previous artificial photosynthesis design, Liu et al. combined the hydrogen-oxidizing bacterium Raistonia eutropha with a cobalt-phosphorus water-splitting catalyst. This biocompatible self-healing electrode circumvented the toxicity challenges of previous designs and allowed it to operate aerobically. When combined with solar photovoltaic cells, solar-to-chemical conversion rates should become nearly an order of magnitude more efficient than natural photosynthesis.Science, this issue p. 1210Artificial photosynthetic systems can store solar energy and chemically reduce CO2. We developed a hybrid water splitting–biosynthetic system based on a biocompatible Earth-abundant inorganic catalyst system to split water into molecular hydrogen and oxygen (H2 and O2) at low driving voltages. When grown in contact with these catalysts, Ralstonia eutropha consumed the produced H2 to synthesize biomass and fuels or chemical products from low CO2 concentration in the presence of O2. This scalable system has a CO2 reduction energy efficiency of \textasciitilde 50\% when producing bacterial biomass and liquid fusel alcohols, scrubbing 180 grams of CO2 per kilowatt-hour of electricity. Coupling this hybrid device to existing photovoltaic systems would yield a CO2 reduction energy efficiency of \textasciitilde 10\%, exceeding that of natural photosynthetic systems.},

  abstract = {The S2 state of the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II, which consists of a Mn4O5Ca cofactor, is EPR-active, typically displaying a multiline signal, which arises from a ground spin state of total spin ST = 1/2. The precise appearance of the signal varies amongst different photosynthetic species, preparation and solvent conditions/compositions. Over the past five years, using the model species Thermosynechococcus elongatus, we have examined modifications that induce changes in the multiline signal, i.e. Ca(2+)/Sr(2+)-substitution and the binding of ammonia, to ascertain how structural perturbations of the cluster are reflected in its magnetic/electronic properties. This refined analysis, which now includes high-field (W-band) data, demonstrates that the electronic structure of the S2 state is essentially invariant to these modifications. This assessment is based on spectroscopies that examine the metal centres themselves (EPR, (55)Mn-ENDOR) and their first coordination sphere ligands ((14)N/(15)N- and (17)O-ESEEM, -HYSCORE and -EDNMR). In addition, extended quantum mechanical models from broken-symmetry DFT now reproduce all EPR, (55)Mn and (14)N experimental magnetic observables, with the inclusion of second coordination sphere ligands being crucial for accurately describing the interaction of NH3 with the Mn tetramer. These results support a mechanism of multiline heterogeneity reported for species differences and the effect of methanol [Biochim. Biophys. Acta, Bioenerg., 2011, 1807, 829], involving small changes in the magnetic connectivity of the solvent accessible outer MnA4 to the cuboidal unit Mn3O3Ca, resulting in predictable changes of the measured effective (55)Mn hyperfine tensors. Sr(2+) and NH3 replacement both affect the observed (17)O-EDNMR signal envelope supporting the assignment of O5 as the exchangeable μ-oxo bridge and it acting as the first site of substrate inclusion.},

Its reaction cycle is composed of five intermediate (Si) states, where the index i indicates the number of oxidizing equivalents stored by the cofactor. After formation of the S4 state, the product dioxygen is released and the cofactor returns to its lowest oxidation state, S0. Membrane-inlet mass spectrometry measurements suggest that at least one substrate is bound throughout the catalytic cycle, as the rate of 18O-labeled water incorporation into the product O2 is slow, on a millisecond to second timescale depending on the S state. Here, we demonstrate that the Mn4O5Ca complex poised in the S0 state contains an exchangeable hydroxo bridge.

Most implementations solve the DMFT equations using quantum Monte-Carlo sampling on the imaginary time and frequency (Matsubara) axis. We will here review alternative methods using exact diagonalization, i.e., representing the many-body ground state of the impurity as a sum over Slater determinants and calculating Green's functions using iterative Lanczos procedures. The advantage being that these methods have no sign problem, can handle involved multi-orbital Hamiltonians (low crystal symmetry, spin-orbit coupling) and-when working completely on the real axis-do not need a mathematically ill-posed analytical continuation. The disadvantage of traditional implementations of exact diagonalization has been the exponential scaling of the calculation problem as a function of number of bath discretization points. In the last part we will review how recent advances in exact diagonalization can evade the exponential barrier thereby increasing the number of bath discretization points to reach the thermodynamic limit.}

It removes the self-interaction energies of those Wannier functions, and yields accurate band gaps for solids compared to experiments. It does not have any adjustable parameters and the computational cost is at the DFT level. This method can also work for molecules, providing eigen energies in good agreement with experimental ionization potentials and electron affinities.

Our results confirm that P-EOM-MBPT2 can provide reasonable EAs when molecules with significant multireference character are not considered and its mean absolute error on EAs of these molecules is around or less than 0.2 eV. Its accuracy is comparable to that of the more expensive EOM-CCSD(2) method. Results of EOM-CCSD(2), P-EOM-MBPT2, and CIS(D∞) indicate that the [[H, ac+], T2] term in the 1h2p-1h block is more important on EAs than the term neglected in the 1h2p-1h2p block in P-EOM-MBPT2. We proposed an economical method where EAs from CIS(D∞) are corrected by treating this [[H, ac+], T2] term in the 1h2p-1h block perturbatively [corr-CIS(D∞)]. EAs with corr-CIS(D∞) agree very well with those of P-EOM-MBPT2 with a difference of less than 0.02 eV. Computational scaling of this method is N4 for the iterative part and N5 for some non-iterative steps. Its storage requirement is only of OV3. Corr-CIS(D∞) is an economical and reliable method on EAs, and it can be applied to EAs of large molecules.},

  abstract = {Wannier functions are real-space representations of Bloch orbitals that provide a useful picture for chemical bonding and offer a localized description of single-particle wave functions. There is a unitary freedom in the construction of Wannier functions from Bloch orbitals, which can be chosen to produce Wannier functions that have advantageous properties. A popular choice for this freedom is the minimization of spatial variance, which leads to maximally localized Wannier functions. We minimize a weighted sum of the spatial and energy variances, yielding what we call dually localized Wannier functions. Localization in energy results in Wannier functions that are associated with a particular energy and allows for dually localized Wannier functions to be comprised of occupied and unoccupied spaces simulatneously. This can lead to Wannier functions that are fractionally occupied, which is a key feature that is used in correcting the delocalization error in density functional approximations. We show how this type of localization results in bonding (antibonding) functions for the occupied (unoccupied) spaces around the frontier energy of silicon in the diamond lattice and of molecular ethylene. Dually localized Wannier functions therefore offer a relevant description for chemical bonding and are well suited to orbital-dependent methods that associate Wannier functions with specific energy ranges without the need to consider the occupied and unoccupied spaces separately.},

The localized orbital scaling correction (LOSC) was developed to correct delocalization error by using orbitals localized in space and energy. These localized orbitals span both the occupied and unoccupied spaces and can have fractional occupations in order to correct both the total energy and the one-electron energy eigenvalues. We extend the LOSC method to periodic systems, in which the localized orbitals employed are dually localized Wannier functions. In light of the effect of the bulk environment on the electrostatic interaction between localized orbitals, we modify the LOSC energy correction to include a screened Coulomb kernel. For a test set of semiconductors and large-gap insulators, we show that the screened LOSC method consistently improves the band gap compared to the parent density functional approximation.},

The strongest change across the transition is found at the topmost valence band edge (VBE), which is commonly associated with the Zhang-Rice bound state. This VBE state strengthens in the AFM phase, but only for the minority spin component, which is subject to stronger fluctuations.

  abstract = {A novel stochastic Complete Active Space Self-Consistent Field (CASSCF) method has been developed and implemented in the Molcas software package. A two-step procedure is used, in which the CAS configuration interaction secular equations are solved stochastically with the Full Configuration Interaction Quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) approach, while orbital rotations are performed using an approximated form of the Super-CI method. This new method does not suffer from the strong combinatorial limitations of standard MCSCF implementations using direct schemes and can handle active spaces well in excess of those accessible to traditional CASSCF approaches. The density matrix formulation of the Super-CI method makes this step independent of the size of the CI expansion, depending exclusively on one- and two-body density matrices with indices restricted to the relatively small number of active orbitals. No sigma vectors need to be stored in memory for the FCIQMC eigensolver—a substantial gain in comparison to impl...},

Quasiparticle energies are calculated within the GW approximation for the self-energy. Optical properties are evaluated either by solving the Bethe–Salpeter equation or by using the adiabatic local density approximation. yambo is a plane-wave code that, although particularly suited for calculations of periodic bulk systems, has been applied to a large variety of physical systems. yambo relies on efficient numerical techniques devised to treat systems with reduced dimensionality, or with a large number of degrees of freedom.

  title = {An {{Introduction}} to {{Maximally-Localized Wannier Functions}}},
  author = {Marzari, Nicola and Souza, Ivo and Vanderbilt, David},
  abstract = {The electronic ground state of a periodic system is usually described in terms of extended Bloch orbitals, simultaneous eigenstates of the periodic Hamiltonian and of the direct lattice translations. An alternative representation in terms of localized orbitals has been introduced by Gregory Wannier in 1937; besides its theoretical relevance in several areas of solid-state theory, it has gained recent prominence due to its connection with the Berry-phase theory of bulk polarization, the interest in linear-scaling approaches, and with the development of general algorithms to derive Wannier functions in the framework of first-principles electronic structure calculations. The connection between the Bloch representation and the Wannier representation is realized by families of transformations in a continuous space of unitary matrices, carrying a large degree of arbitrariness. A few years ago we have developed a localization algorithm that allows one to iteratively transform the extended Bloch orbitals of a first-principles calculation into a unique set of maximally-localized Wannier functions (MLWFs), extending and encompassing Boys formulation for molecules to the solid-state case. The localization algorithm is independent of the single-particle electronic structure approach adopted, or the choice of basis set, and it is straightforwardly applied to extended or periodic solids and to isolated systems. Additionally, a novel disentanglement procedure allows to extract a maximally-connected manifold of any chosen dimension from a given energy window, leading to the extension of the original algorithm to the case of systems without gaps (e.g., metals) and removing the limitation to isolated groups of bands separated by gaps from higher and lower manifolds. In this Highlight we will outline and summarize the main results of the theory and algorithm underlying the maximally-localized Wannier-functions representation, and review some of the applications that have since appeared in the literature.}

Recent times have seen the development of increasingly active molecular WOCs, the study of which affords an understanding of catalytic mechanisms and decomposition pathways. This Perspective offers a historical description of the landmark molecular WOCs, particularly ruthenium systems, that have guided research to our present degree of understanding.},

In particular, formation energies of the charged and neutral forms of the VOx and Ti(i) defects as well as the corresponding vertical and thermodynamic transition levels have been estimated. The achieved results can reconcile the apparent inconsistency of experimentally observed deep donor levels with the n-type conductivity observed in reduced TiO2. They show indeed that both defects give rise to vertical transition levels about 1 eV below the conduction band (CB), in agreement with experimental measures, and to thermodynamic transition levels close to the CB. That is, these defects behave as deep donors, when looking at vertical transitions, and as shallow donors, when the effects of the structural relaxations are taken into account.

  abstract = {The ab initio GW plus Bethe–Salpeter equation (GW-BSE, where G is the one particle Green's function and W is the screened Coulomb interaction) approach has emerged as a leading method for predicting excitations in both solids and molecules with a predictive power contingent upon several factors. Among these factors are the (1) generalized Kohn–Sham eigensystem used to construct the GW self-energy and to solve the BSE and (2) the efficacy and suitability of the Tamm–Dancoff approximation. Here, we present a detailed benchmark study of low-lying singlet excitations from a generalized Kohn–Sham (gKS) starting point based on an optimally tuned range-separated hybrid (OTRSH) functional. We show that the use of this gKS starting point with one-shot G0W0 and G0W0-BSE leads to the lowest mean absolute errors (MAEs) and mean signed errors (MSEs), with respect to high-accuracy reference values, demonstrated in the literature thus far for the ionization potentials of the GW100 benchmark set and for low-lying neutral excitations of Thiel’s set molecules in the gas phase, without the need for self-consistency. The MSEs and MAEs of one-shot G0W0-BSE@OTRSH excitation energies are comparable to or lower than those obtained with other functional starting points after self-consistency. Additionally, we compare these results with linear-response time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations and find GW-BSE to be superior to TDDFT when calculations are based on the same exchange-correlation functional. This work demonstrates tuned range-separated hybrids used in combination with GW and GW-BSE can greatly suppress starting point dependence for molecules, leading to accuracy similar to that for higher-order wavefunction-based theories for molecules without the need for costlier iterations to self-consistency.},

However, the application of LOSC to DFAs was mainly through a post self-consistent field (SCF) manner, and few results from applying LOSC to DFAs in an SCF manner have been reported. The reason is that the originally proposed SCF approach to SCF−LOSC calculation uses an approximate Hamiltonian and encounters convergence problems easily in practice. In this work, we develop a new SCF approach with a correct Hamiltonian and achieve reliable SCF−LOSC calculations. We demonstrate the capability of the new SCF approach for SCF−LOSC to correctly describe the electron densities, total energies, and energy-level alignment for the molecular dissociation process, while conventional DFAs or LOSC−DFAs with post-SCF calculations show large errors. This work demonstrates that the new SCF approach for SCF−LOSC would be a promising method for studying problems for correct electron densities and energy-level alignments in large systems.},

Based on extensive numerical results, the SC methods have been demonstrated to be capable of reducing the delocalization error effectively and producing accurate descriptions for many critical and challenging problems, including the fundamental gap, photoemission spectroscopy, charge transfer excitations and polarizability. In the development of SC methods, the SC methods were mainly implemented in the QM4D package that was developed in the Yang laboratory for research development. The heavy dependency on the QM4D package hinders the SC methods from access by researchers for broad applications. In this work, we developed a reliable and efficient implementation , LibSC for the global scaling correction (GSC) method and the localized orbital scaling correction (LOSC) method. LibSC will serve as a light-weight and open-source library that can be easily accessed by the quantum chemistry community. The implementation of LibSC is carefully modularized to provide the essential functionalities for conducting calculations of the SC methods. In addition, LibSC provides simple and consistent interfaces to support multiple popular programing languages, including C, C++ and Python. In addition to the development of the library, we also integrated LibSC with two popular and open-source quantum chemistry packages, the Psi4 package and the PySCF package, which provides immediate access for general users to perform calculations with SC methods.},

The method, based on the previously developed global scaling correction (GSC), is an exact quadratic correction to the DFA for the fractional charge behavior and uses the analytical second derivatives of the total energy with respect to fractional occupation numbers of the canonical molecular orbitals. For small and medium-size molecules, this correction leads to ground-state orbital energies that are a highly accurate approximation to the corresponding quasiparticle energies. It provides excellent predictions of ionization potentials, electron affinities, photoemission spectrum, and photoexcitation energies beyond previous approximate second-order approaches, thus showing potential for broad applications in computational spectroscopy.},

We present a large-scale first-principles evaluation of the zero-point renormalization of band edges beyond the adiabatic approximation. For materials with light elements, the band gap renormalization is often larger than 0.3\,eV, and up to 0.7\,eV. This effect cannot be ignored if accurate band gaps are sought. For infrared-active materials, global agreement with available experimental data is obtained only when non-adiabatic effects are taken into account. They even dominate zero-point renormalization for many materials, as shown by a generalized Fröhlich model that includes multiple phonon branches, anisotropic and degenerate electronic extrema, whose range of validity is established by comparison with first-principles results.},

  abstract = {Hubbard U and Hund J values provide a measure of the self-interaction between correlated electrons, and are crucial parameters in the formalism of density functional theory with a "plus U" correction, known as DFT+U and DFT+U+J. The linear response (LR) methodology has proven to be a computationally effective and self-contained method for computing accurate U and J values. This study provides a high-throughput computational analysis of the U and J values applied to transition metal d-electron states in a representative set of magnetic transition metal oxides (TMOs). In a less conventional pursuit, over two hundred system-specific U and J corrections are calculated for oxygen 2p on-site occupations. The distributions of values are analyzed for structures containing manganese, iron and nickel-containing compounds, with sample sizes of over 150 for each species. In addition, periodic tables of U and J values are presented for transition metal and oxygen species from a combined data set of over 800 TMO compounds. Our work provides a frame of reference for researchers who utilize DFT+U to study TMO materials, and to gain insight into the distribution of U values that may be relevant to their applications. An atomate workflow is presented for calculating U and J values automatically on massively parallel supercomputing architectures. To validate this method, the spin-canting magnetic structure and unit cell parameters of a known multiferroic, olivine LiNiPO4, are predicted using the computed Hubbard U and Hund J values for Ni-d and O-p on-site occupancies, and are compared with experiment. It was confirmed that in addition to Ni-d U values, applying a separate Hund J to Ni-d has a strong effect on Ni-moment canting angle. Additionally, including a O-p U value results in a significantly improved agreement between DFT-computed lattice parameters and experiment.},

These two conditions are now unified and extended to states with both fractional charge and fractional spin to give a much more stringent condition: the exact energy functional is a plane, linear along the fractional charge coordinate and constant along the fractional spin coordinate with a line of discontinuity at the integer. Violation of this condition underlies the failure of all known approximate functionals to describe the gaps in strongly correlated systems. It is shown that explicitly discontinuous functionals of the density or orbitals that go beyond these currently used smooth approximations is the key for the application of density functional theory to strongly correlated systems. © 2009 The American Physical Society.},

Variable temperature variable field (VTVH) Magnetic Circular Dichroism (MCD) spectra in PSII of Thermosynochococcus (T.) vulcanus for each S-state are reported. These spectra, along with assignments, provide a new window into the electronic and magnetic structure of Mn4CaO5. VTVH MCD spectra taken in the S2 state provide a clear g=2, S=1/2 paramagnetic characteristic, which is entirely consistent with that known by EPR. The three features, seen as positive (+) at 749nm, negative (−) at 773nm and (+) at 808nm are assigned as 4A→2E spin-flips within the d3 configuration of the Mn(IV) centres present. This assignment is supported by comparison(s) to spin-flips seen in a range of Mn(IV) materials. S3 exhibits a more intense (−) MCD peak at 764nm and has a stronger MCD saturation characteristic. This S3 MCD saturation behaviour can be accurately modelled using parameters taken directly from analyses of EPR spectra. We see no evidence for Mn(III) d-d absorption in the near-IR of any S-state. We suggest that Mn(IV)-based absorption may be responsible for the well-known near-IR induced changes induced in S2 EPR spectra of T. vulcanus and not Mn(III)-based, as has been commonly assumed. Through an analysis of the nephelauxetic effect, the excitation energy of S-state dependent spin-flips seen may help identify coordination characteristics and changes at each Mn(IV). A prospectus as to what more detailed S-state dependent MCD studies promise to achieve is outlined.},

We present a general preconditioning scheme to overcome this ill-conditioning and implement it within our own first-principles linear-scaling density functional theory method. The scheme may be applied in either real space or reciprocal space with equal success. The rate of convergence is improved by an order of magnitude and is found to be almost independent of the size of the basis.},

Defining \$U\$ as an implicit functional of the ground-state density implies the comparability of DFT + Hubbard \$U\$ (DFT+\$U\$) total-energies, and related properties, as external parameters such as ionic positions are varied together with their corresponding first-principles \$U\$ values. Our approach provides a framework in which to address the partially unresolved question of self-consistency over \$U\$, for which plausible schemes have been proposed, and to precisely define the energy associated with subspace many-body self-interaction error. We demonstrate that DFT+\$U\$ precisely corrects the total energy for self-interaction error under ideal conditions, but only if a simple self-consistency condition is applied. Such parameters also promote to first-principles a recently proposed DFT+\$U\$ based method for enforcing Koopmans' theorem.},

  abstract = {The free energy surfaces and reaction mechanisms underlying the activation of amino acids by COS in bulk water at ambient conditions as well as extreme temperature−pressure thermodynamic conditions were studied using accelerated ab initio molecular dynamics. The results for the reaction sequence leading from glycine to its activated form, a so-called Leuchs anhydride or α-amino acid N-carboxyanhydride (NCA), suggest that extreme conditions not far from the critical point of water may favor the formation of this activated species. This is traced back to appropriately affecting relative stabilities of neutral versus charged or zwitterionic molecular species which shifts equilibria, affects relative barriers, and thus modifies reaction rates. Furthermore, it is shown that the N-carboxyanhydride of glycine is not formed from N-thiocarboxyl glycine by its direct cyclization, but instead an indirect mechanism, the so-called isocyanate route, is clearly preferred at both conditions. The work quantitatively underpins the impact of extreme solvent conditions on the investigated organic reactions in aqueous media which implies that the presented results are of relevance to fields such as prebiotic chemistry and green chemistry.},

  abstract = {Standard flavors of density-functional theory (DFT) calculations are known to fail in describing anions, due to large self-interaction errors. The problem may be circumvented using localized basis sets of reduced size, leaving no variational flexibility for the extra electron to delocalize. Alternatively, a recent approach exploiting DFT evaluations of total energies on electronic densities optimized at the Hartree-Fock (HF) level has been reported, showing that the self-interaction-free HF densities are able to lead to an improved description of the additional electron, returning affinities in close agreement with the experiments. Nonetheless, such an approach can fail when the HF densities are too inaccurate. Here, an alternative approach is presented, in which an embedding environment is used to stabilize the anion in a bound configuration. Similar to the HF case, when computing total energies at the DFT level on these corrected densities, electron affinities in very good agreement with experiments can be recovered. The effect of the environment can be evaluated and removed by an extrapolation of the results to the limit of vanishing embedding. Apart from the definition of the domain of the embedding potential, the approach is free from parameters and it can be easily applied to DFT calculations with delocalized basis sets, e.g., plane waves, for which alternative approaches are either not viable or more computationally demanding. The proposed extrapolation strategy can be thus applied also to extended systems, as often studied in condensed-matter physics and materials science, and we illustrate how the embedding environment can be exploited to determine the energy of an adsorbing anion, here a chloride ion on a metal surface, whose charge configuration would be incorrectly predicted by standard density functionals.},

We argue that proofs of these theorems rely critically on the finiteness of the number of particles comprising the considered systems. We revisit the problem with focus on extended systems and we confirm the Koopmans' theorem validity. On the other hand, we establish the IP-theorem's violation within the context of KS DFT of extended systems. These findings have an immediate bearing on the role of the KS valence band at solid surfaces, mesoscopic, and other extended systems with respect to the work-function problem. Based on our results, we introduce a concept of the ionization potential band structure as an observable alternative to its unphysical KS counterpart. A method of practical determination of IP band structure in terms of DFT quantities is provided.},

The cases covered include geometric, electric, magnetic and time-dependent perturbations. The developed theoretical apparatus is then applied to the calculations of molecular structures, vibrational energies as well as a wide variety of properties including absorption, circular dichroism, magnetic circular dichroism, resonance Raman, X-ray absorption, Mössbauer and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies. Finally, the important subjects of spin state energetics and exchange couplings in oligomeric transition metal clusters is discussed.}

Although the structure of the OEC is known at atomic level for its dark-stable state, the mechanism by which water is oxidized remains unsettled. Important mechanistic information was gained in the past two decades by mass spectrometric studies of the H2(18)O/H2(16)O substrate-water exchange in the four (semi) stable redox states of the OEC. However, until now such data were not attainable in the transient states formed immediately before the O-O bond formation. Using modified photosystem II complexes displaying up to 40-fold slower O2 production rates, we show here that in the transient S3YZ state the substrate-water exchange is dramatically slowed as compared with the earlier S states. This further constrains the possible sites for substrate-water binding in photosystem II.},

Consequently, the development of active and stable water oxidation catalysts is crucial, with heterogeneous systems considered more suitable for practical use and their homogeneous counterparts more suitable for targeted, molecular-level design guided by mechanistic understanding. Research into the mechanism of water oxidation has resulted in a range of synthetic molecular catalysts, yet there remains much interest in systems that use abundant, inexpensive and environmentally benign metals such as iron (the most abundant transition metal in the Earth's crust and found in natural and synthetic oxidation catalysts). Water oxidation catalysts based on mononuclear iron complexes have been explored, but they often deactivate rapidly and exhibit relatively low activities. Here we report a pentanuclear iron complex that efficiently and robustly catalyses water oxidation with a turnover frequency of 1,900 per second, which is about three orders of magnitude larger than that of other iron-based catalysts. Electrochemical analysis confirms the redox flexibility of the system, characterized by six different oxidation states between Fe(II)5 and Fe(III)5; the Fe(III)5 state is active for oxidizing water. Quantum chemistry calculations indicate that the presence of adjacent active sites facilitates O-O bond formation with a reaction barrier of less than ten kilocalories per mole. Although the need for a high overpotential and the inability to operate in water-rich solutions limit the practicality of the present system, our findings clearly indicate that efficient water oxidation catalysts based on iron complexes can be created by ensuring that the system has redox flexibility and contains adjacent water-activation sites.},

The compounds investigated comprise the layered AMO2 and AMS2 structures, the olivine and maricite AMPO4 structures, and the NASICON A3V2(PO4)3 structures. The calculated Na voltages for the compounds investigated are 0.18–0.57 V lower than that of the corresponding Li voltages, in agreement with previous experimental data. We believe the observed lower voltages for Na compounds are predominantly a cathodic effect related to the much smaller energy gain from inserting Na into the host structure compared to inserting Li. We also found a relatively strong dependence of battery properties on structural features. In general, the difference between the Na and Li voltage of the same structure, ΔVNa–Li, is less negative for the maricite structures preferred by Na, and more negative for the olivine structures preferred by Li. The layered compounds have the most negative ΔVNa–Li. In terms of phase stability, we found that open structures, such as the layered and NASICON structures, that are better able to accommodate the larger Na+ ion generally have both Na and Li versions of the same compound. For the close-packed AMPO4 structures, our results show that Na generally prefers the maricite structure, while Li prefers the olivine structure, in agreement with previous experimental work. We also found surprising evidence that the barriers for Na+ migration can potentially be lower than that for Li+ migration in the layered structures. Overall, our findings indicate that Na-ion systems can be competitive with Li-ion systems.},

  abstract = {Electronic excitations lie at the origin of most of the commonly measured spectra. However, the first-principles computation of excited states requires a larger effort than ground-state calculations, which can be very efficiently carried out within density-functional theory. On the other hand, two theoretical and computational tools have come to prominence for the description of electronic excitations. One of them, many-body perturbation theory, is based on a set of Green's-function equations, starting with a one-electron propagator and considering the electron-hole Green's function for the response. Key ingredients are the electron's self-energy Σ and the electron-hole interaction. A good approximation for Σ is obtained with Hedin's GW approach, using density-functional theory as a zero-order solution. First-principles GW calculations for real systems have been successfully carried out since the 1980s. Similarly, the electron-hole interaction is well described by the Bethe-Salpeter equation, via a functional derivative of Σ. An alternative approach to calculating electronic excitations is the time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT), which offers the important practical advantage of a dependence on density rather than on multivariable Green's functions. This approach leads to a screening equation similar to the Bethe-Salpeter one, but with a two-point, rather than a four-point, interaction kernel. At present, the simple adiabatic local-density approximation has given promising results for finite systems, but has significant deficiencies in the description of absorption spectra in solids, leading to wrong excitation energies, the absence of bound excitonic states, and appreciable distortions of the spectral line shapes. The search for improved TDDFT potentials and kernels is hence a subject of increasing interest. It can be addressed within the framework of many-body perturbation theory: in fact, both the Green's functions and the TDDFT approaches profit from mutual insight. This review compares the theoretical and practical aspects of the two approaches and their specific numerical implementations, and presents an overview of accomplishments and work in progress.},

The water oxidase in PS II contains a Mn4Ca cluster (oxygen evolving complex\{,\} OEC)\{,\} whose catalytic mechanism has been extensively investigated but is still unresolved. In particular the precise Mn oxidation levels through which the cluster cycles during functional turnover are still contentious. In this\{,\} the first of several planned parts\{,\} we examine a broad range of published data relating to this question\{,\} while considering the recent atomic resolution PS II crystal structure of Umena et al. (Nature\{,\} 2011\{,\} 473\{,\} 55). Results from X-ray\{,\} UV-Vis and NIR spectroscopies are considered\{,\} using an approach that is mainly empirical\{,\} by comparison with published data from known model systems\{,\} but with some reliance on computational or other theoretical considerations. The intention is to survey the extent to which these data yield a consistent picture of the Mn oxidation states in functional PS II - in particular\{,\} to test their consistency with two current proposals for the mean redox levels of the OEC during turnover; the so called \{'\}high\{'\} and \{'\}low\{'\} oxidation state paradigms. These systematically differ by two oxidation equivalents throughout the redox accumulating catalytic S state cycle (states S0S3). In summary\{,\} we find that the data\{,\} in total\{,\} substantially favor the low oxidation proposal\{,\} particularly as a result of the new analyses we present. The low oxidation state scheme is able to resolve a number of previously \{'\}anomalous\{'\} results in the observed UV-Visible S state turnover spectral differences and in the resonant inelastic X-ray spectroscopy (RIXS) of the Mn pre-edge region of the S1 and S2 states. Further\{,\} the low oxidation paradigm is able to provide a \{'\}natural\{'\} explanation for the known sensitivity of the OEC Mn cluster to cryogenic near infra-red (NIR) induced turnover to alternative spin/redox states in S2 and S3.}

The set includes ten models based on the \{'\}fused twist\{'\} core topology derived by polarized EXAFS spectra and two related models proposed in recent mechanistic investigations. Optimized geometries and spin population analyses suggest that Mn(iii)\{,\} which is most often identified with the manganese ion at site D\{,\} is always associated with a penta-coordinate environment\{,\} unless a chloride is directly ligated to the metal. Exchange coupling constants were determined by broken-symmetry density functional theory calculations and the complete spectrum of magnetic sublevels was obtained by direct diagonalization of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian. Seven models display a doublet ground state and are considered spectroscopic models for the ground state corresponding to the multiline signal (MLS) of the S2 state of the OEC\{,\} whereas the remaining five models display a sextet ground state and could be related to the g = 4.1 signal of the S2 state. It is found that the sign of the exchange coupling constant between the Mn centres at positions A and B of the cluster is directly related to the ground state multiplicity\{,\} implying that interconversion between the doublet and sextet can be induced by only small structural perturbations. The recently proposed quantum chemical method for the calculation of 55Mn hyperfine coupling constants is subsequently applied to the S2 MLS state models and the quantities that enter into the individual steps of the procedure (site-spin expectation values\{,\} intrinsic site isotropic hyperfine parameters and projected 55Mn isotropic hyperfine constants) are analyzed and discussed in detail with respect to the structural and electronic features of each model. The current approach performs promisingly. It reacts sensitively to structural distortions and hence may be able to distinguish between different structural proposals. Thus it emerges as a useful contributor to the ongoing efforts that aim at establishing correlations between the body of spectroscopic data available for the various Si states of the OEC and their actual geometric features.}

  abstract = {The sunlight-powered oxidation of water by photosystem II (PSII) of algae, plants, and cyanobacteria underpins the energy conversion processes that sustain most life on our planet. Understanding the structure and function of the “engine of life”, the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) in the active site of PSII, has been one of the great and persistent challenges of modern science. Immense progress has been achieved in recent years through combined contributions of diverse disciplines and research approaches, yet the challenge remains. The improved understanding of the tetramanganese–calcium cluster of the OEC for the experimentally accessible catalytic states often creates a more complex picture of the system than previously imagined, while the various strands of evidence cannot always be unified into a coherent model. This review focuses on selected current problems that relate to structural–electronic features of the OEC, emphasizing conceptual aspects and highlighting topics of structure and function that remain uncertain or controversial. The Mn4CaOx cluster of the OEC cycles through five redox states (S0–S4) to store the oxidizing equivalents required for the final step of dioxygen evolution in the spontaneously decaying S4 state. Remarkably, even the dark-stable state of the OEC, the S1 state, is still incompletely understood because the available structural models do not fully explain the complexity revealed by spectroscopic investigations. In addition to the nature of the dioxygen-evolving S4 state and the precise mechanism of O–O bond formation, major current open questions include the type and role of structural heterogeneity in various intermediate states of the OEC, the sequence of events in the highly complex S2–S3 transition, the heterogeneous nature of the S3 state, the accessibility of substrate or substrate analogues, the identification of substrate oxygen atoms, and the role of the protein matrix in mediating proton removal and substrate delivery. These open questions and their implications for understanding the principles of catalytic control in the OEC must be convincingly addressed before biological water oxidation can be understood in its full complexity on both the atomic and systemic levels.}

Oxidized samples of the complex show electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signals at g ≈ 4.9 and 2, similar to those associated with the OEC in its S2 state (g ≈ 4.1 from an S = 5/2 form and g ≈ 2 from an S = 1/2 form), suggesting similarities in the electronic as well as geometric structure.

  abstract = {Some fundamental issues in ground-state density functional theory are discussed without equations: (1) The standard Hohenberg−Kohn and Kohn−Sham theorems were proven for a Hamiltonian that is not quite exact for real atoms, molecules, and solids. (2) The density functional for the exchange-correlation energy, which must be approximated, arises from the tendency of electrons to avoid one another as they move through the electron density. (3) In the absence of a magnetic field, either spin densities or total electron density can be used, although the former choice is better for approximations. (4) “Spin contamination” of the determinant of Kohn−Sham orbitals for an open-shell system is not wrong but right. (5) Only to the extent that symmetries of the interacting wave function are reflected in the spin densities should those symmetries be respected by the Kohn−Sham noninteracting or determinantal wave function. Functionals below the highest level of approximations should however sometimes break even those symmetries, for good physical reasons. (6) Simple and commonly used semilocal (lower-level) approximations for the exchange-correlation energy as a functional of the density can be accurate for closed systems near equilibrium and yet fail for open systems of fluctuating electron number. (7) The exact Kohn−Sham noninteracting state need not be a single determinant, but common approximations can fail when it is not. (8) Over an open system of fluctuating electron number, connected to another such system by stretched bonds, semilocal approximations make the exchange-correlation energy and hole-density sum rule too negative. (9) The gap in the exact Kohn−Sham band structure of a crystal underestimates the real fundamental gap but may approximate the first exciton energy in the large-gap limit. (10) Density functional theory is not really a mean-field theory, although it looks like one. The exact functional includes strong correlation, and semilocal approximations often overestimate the strength of static correlation through their semilocal exchange contributions. (11) Only under rare conditions can excited states arise directly from a ground-state theory.},

In addition, recent magnetic resonance data have allowed the structure of the cofactor to be accessed in its last metastable intermediate state, prior to O–O bond formation. This activated form of the catalyst is geometrically similar to that seen by X-ray crystallography, which represents the resting state of the cofactor, but requires the coordination of an additional water molecule to the cofactor, rendering all Mn ions six coordinate. Importantly, it locates two water derived, Mn bound oxygen ligands in close proximity. It is these two oxygen ligands that likely form the product O2 molecule, as proposed earlier by quantum chemical modeling. Current views on the molecular level events that facilitate catalyst activation, that is, catalyst/substrate deprotonation, Mn oxidation and water molecule insertion are briefly described.},

Such interactions may account for the lengthening of the Mn-Mn distances observed in the most recent and highest resolution (1.9 A) crystal structure of PS II compared to earlier\{,\} lower-resolution (2.9 A or greater) XRD structures and EXAFS studies on functional PS II. Density functional theory is used to examine the influence on Mn-Mn distances of H-bonding interactions\{,\} mediated by the proximate His337 residue\{,\} which may lead to either partial or complete protonation of the [small mu ]3-oxo bridge on models of the WOC. Calculations were performed on a set of minimal-complexity models (in which WOC-ligating amino acid residues are represented as formate and imidazole ligands)\{,\} and also on extended models in which a 13-peptide sequence (from His332 to Ala344) is treated explicitly. These calculations demonstrate that while the 2.9 A structure is best described by models in which the [small mu ]3-oxo bridge is neither protonated nor involved in significant H-bonding\{,\} the 1.9 A XRD structure is better reproduced by models in which the [small mu ]3-oxo bridge undergoes H-bonding interactions with the His337 residue leading to expansion of the \{'\}close\{'\} Mn-Mn distances well known from EXAFS studies at [similar] 2.7 A. Furthermore\{,\} full [small mu ]3-oxo-bridge protonation remains a distinct possibility during the process of water oxidation\{,\} as evidenced by the lengthening of the Mn-Mn vectors observed in EXAFS studies of the higher oxidation states of PS II.

In contrast with several other theoretical studies addressing this structure\{,\} we find that it is not necessary to invoke photoreduction of the crystalline sample below the S1 \{'\}resting state\{'\} in order to rationalise the observed WOC geometry. Our results are consistent with crystallised PSII in the S1 state\{,\} with S1 corresponding to either (MnIII)4 or (MnIII)2(MnIV)2 as required by the two competing paradigms for the WOC oxidation state pattern. Of these two paradigms\{,\} the \{'\}low-oxidation-state\{'\} paradigm provides a better match for the crystal structure\{,\} with the comparatively long Mn(2)-Mn(3) distance in particular proving difficult to reconcile with the \{'\}high-oxidation-state\{'\} model. Best agreement with the set of metal-metal distances is obtained with a S1 model featuring [small mu ]-O\{,\} [small mu ]-OH bridging between Mn(3) and Mn(4) and deprotonation of one water ligand on Mn(4).

In this paper, we expand our previous work and show that this bias could be partly removed with a combined CASPT2/CC approach: using high-quality CASPT2 with extensive correlation-consistent basis sets for valence correlation and low-cost CCSD(T) calculations with minimal basis sets for the metal semicore (3s3p) correlation effects.

  abstract = {This paper presents an in-depth study of the performance of multiconfigurational second-order perturbation theory (CASPT2, NEVPT2) in describing spin state energetics in first-row transition metal (TM) systems, including bare TM ions, TM ions in a field of point charges (TM/PC), and an extensive series of TM complexes, where the main focus lies on the (3s3p) correlation contribution to the relative energies of different spin states. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic NEVPT2 investigation of TM spin state energetics. CASPT2 has been employed in several previous studies but was regularly found to be biased toward high spin states. The bias was attributed to a too low value of the so-called IPEA shift ϵ, an empirical correction in the CASPT2 zeroth-order Hamiltonian with a standard value of 0.25 hartree. Based on comparisons with experiment (TM ions) and calculations with the multireference configuration interaction (TM ions and TM/PC systems) and coupled-cluster (TM complexes) method...}

Here we report the catalytic activity found in a cobalt hexacyanoferrate (CoHCF) Prussian blue-type coordination polymer. This material is competitive with state-of-the-art metal oxides and exhibits an unparalleled long-term stability at neutral pH and ambient conditions, maintaining constant catalytic rates for weeks. In addition to its remarkable catalytic activity, CoHCF adds the typical properties of molecule-based materials: transparency to visible light, porosity, flexibility, processability, and low density. Such features make CoHCF a promising WOC candidate for advancement in solar fuels production.}

  abstract = {The nature of the bonding in model complexes of di-copper metalloenzymes has been analyzed by means of the electronic localization function (ELF) and by the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM). The constrained space orbital variations (CSOV) approach has also been used. Density functional theory (DFT) and CASSCF calculations have been carried out on several models of tyrosinase such as the sole Cu2O22+ central core, the Cu2O2(NH3)62+ complex and the Cu2O2(Imidazol)62+ complex. The influence on the central Cu2O2 moiety of both levels of calculation and ligand environment have been discussed. The distinct bonding modes have been characterized for the two major known structures: [Cu2(μ–η2: η2–O2)]2+ and [Cu2(μ–O2)]2+. Particular attention has been given to the analysis of the O–O and Cu–O bonds and the nature of the bonding modes has also been analyzed in terms of mesomeric structures. The ELF topological approach shows a significant conservation of the topology between the DFT and CASSCF approaches. Particularly, three-center Cu–O–Cu bonds are observed when the ligands are attached to the central core. At the DFT level, the importance of self interaction effects are emphasized. Although, the DFT approach does not appear to be suitable for the computation of the electronic structure of the isolated Cu2O2 central core, competitive self interaction mechanisms lead to an imperfect but acceptable model when using imidazol ligands. Our results confirm to a certain extent the observations of [M.F. Rode, H.J. Werner, Theoretical Chemistry Accounts 4–5 (2005) 247.] who found a qualitative agreement between B3LYP and localized MRCI calculations when dealing with the Cu2O2 central core with six ammonia ligands.},

The role of the redox-inactive ion in the cluster has not yet been fully clarified, although several experimental data are available on Ca2+-depleted and Ca2+-substituted PSII complexes, indicating Sr2+-substituted PSII as the only modification that preserves oxygen evolution. In this work, we investigated the structural and electronic properties of the PSII catalytic core with Ca2+ replaced with Sr2+ and Cd2+ in the S2 state of the Kok−Joliot cycle by means of density functional theory and ab initio molecular dynamics based on a quantum mechanics/ molecular mechanics approach. Our calculations do not reveal significant differences between the substituted and wild-type systems in terms of geometries, thermodynamics, and kinetics of two previously identified intermediate states along the S2 to S3 transition, namely, the open cubane S2 A and closed cubane S2 B conformers. Conversely, our calculations show different pKa values for the water molecule bound to the three investigated heterocations. Specifically, for Cd-substituted PSII, the pKa value is 5.3 units smaller than the respective value in wild type Ca-PSII. On the basis of our results, we conclude that, assuming all the cations sharing the same binding site, the induced difference in the acidity of the binding pocket might influence the hydrogen bonding network and the redox levels to prevent the further evolution of the cycle toward the S3 state.}

In the past few years the development of Wannier90 has transitioned to a community-driven model; this has resulted in a number of new developments that have been recently released in Wannier90 v3.0. In this article we describe these new functionalities, that include the implementation of new features for wannierisation and disentanglement (symmetry-adapted Wannier functions, selectively-localised Wannier functions, selected columns of the density matrix) and the ability to calculate new properties (shift currents and Berry-curvature dipole, and a new interface to many-body perturbation theory); performance improvements, including parallelisation of the core code; enhancements in functionality (support for spinor-valued Wannier functions, more accurate methods to interpolate quantities in the Brillouin zone); improved usability (improved plotting routines, integration with high-throughput automation frameworks), as well as the implementation of modern software engineering practices (unit testing, continuous integration, and automatic source-code documentation). These new features, capabilities, and code development model aim to further sustain and expand the community uptake and range of applicability, that nowadays spans complex and accurate dielectric, electronic, magnetic, optical, topological and transport properties of materials.},

Adopting these criteria we obtain curated pseudopotential libraries (named SSSP or standard solid-state pseudopotential libraries), that we target for high-throughput materials screening (“SSSP efficiency”) and high-precision materials modelling (“SSSP precision”).

Contemporary functionals undershoot the dissociation of symmetric charged dimers A2+, a simple but stringent test, predict a spurious barrier, and improperly delocalize charges for charged molecular clusters. We extend a functional designed for nondynamic correlation to treat the charge delocalization error by modifying the nondynamic correlation for parallel spins. The modified functional eliminates those problems and reduces the multielectron self-interaction error. Furthermore, its results are the closest to those of CCSD(T) in the whole range of the dissociation compared with contemporary functionals. It correctly localizes the net positive charge in (CH4)n+ clusters and predicts a nearly constant ionization potential as a result. Testing of the SIE4x4 set shows that the new functional outperforms a wide variety of functionals assessed for this set in the literature. Overall, we show the feasibility of treating charge delocalization together with nondynamic correlation.},

To diagnose and correct the overdelocalization of spin defects, we report an implementation of density-corrected (DC-)DFT and its analytic energy gradient. In DC-DFT, an exchange-correlation functional is evaluated using a Hartree–Fock density, thus incorporating electron correlation while avoiding self-interaction error. Results for an electron polaron in models of titania and a hole polaron in Al-doped silica demonstrate that geometry optimization with semilocal functionals drives significant structural distortion, including the elongation of several bonds, such that subsequent single-point calculations with hybrid functionals fail to afford a localized defect even in cases where geometry optimization with the hybrid functional does localize the polaron. This has significant implications for traditional workflows in computational materials science, where semilocal functionals are often used for structure relaxation. DC-DFT calculations provide a mechanism to detect situations where delocalization error is likely to affect the results.},

In what has become an increasingly standard approach, Kohn–Sham eigenenergies, generated from a DFT calculation with a strategically-chosen exchange–correlation functional “starting point”, are used to construct G and W, and then perturbatively corrected by the resultant GW self-energy. In practice, there are several ways to construct the GW self-energy, and these can lead to variations in predicted quasiparticle energies. For example, for ZnO and TiO2, the GW fundamental gaps reported in the literature can vary by more than 1 eV depending on the GW code used. In this work, we calculate and analyze GW quasiparticle (QP) energies of these and other systems with three different GW codes: BerkeleyGW, Abinit and Yambo. Through a systematic analysis of the GW implementation of these three codes, we identify the primary origin of major discrepancies between codes reported in prior literature to be the different implementations the Coulomb divergence in the Fock exchange term and the frequency integration scheme of the GW self-energy. We then eliminate these discrepancies by using common numerical methods and algorithms, demonstrating that the same quasiparticle energies for a given material can be obtained with different codes, within numerical differences ascribable to the technical details of the underling implementations. This work will be important for users and developers in assessing the precision of future GW applications and methods.},

  abstract = {Many observables such as the density, total energy, or electric current, can be expressed explicitly in terms of the one-body Green's function, which describes electron addition or removal to or from a system. An efficient way to determine such a Green's function is to introduce a self-energy, which is a nonlocal and dynamic effective potential that influences the propagation of particles in an interacting system. The state-of-the art approximation for the self-energy is the GW approximation, where the system to (or from) which the electron is added (or removed) is described as a polarizable, screening, medium. This is expressed by the name of the approximation: ‘GW’ stands for the one-body Green's function G and for W, the dynamically screened Coulomb interaction. The GW approximation is very popular for the calculation of band structures in solids, and increasingly used also to describe nanostructures, clusters, and molecules. As compared to static mean-field approximations for the effective potential, the dynamical screening of the Coulomb interaction in GW leads to a renormalization of energies, to broadening and/or to the observation of additional excitations. An analysis of the approximations that lead to the GW self-energy, and of the underlying picture, explains the successes and the limitations of the approach.

In its original formulation, the polaron problem considers a single charge carrier in a polar crystal interacting with its surrounding lattice. Depending on the spatial extension of the polaron quasiparticle, originating from the coupling between the excess charge and the phonon field, one speaks of small or large polarons. This chapter discusses the modeling of small polarons in real materials, with a particular focus on the archetypal polaron material TiO2. After an introductory part, surveying the fundamental theoretical and experimental aspects of the physics of polarons, the chapter examines how to model small polarons using first-principles schemes in order to predict, understand, and interpret a variety of polaron properties in bulk phases and surfaces. Following the spirit of this handbook, different types of computational procedures and prescriptions are presented with specific instructions on the setup required to model polaron effects.},

The formation of a defect locally perturbs the chemical environment of Hubbard sites in its vicinity, resulting in different Hubbard \$U\$ parameters for different sites. Using oxygen vacancies in SrMnO\$\_3\$ as a model system, we investigate the dependence of \$U\$ on the chemical environment and study its influence on the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of defective bulk and strained thin-film structures. Our results show that a self-consistent \$U\$ improves the description of stoichiometric bulk SrMnO\$\_3\$ with respect to GGA or GGA+\$U\$ calculations using an empirical \$U\$. For defective systems, \$U\$ changes as a function of the distance of the Hubbard site from the defect, its oxidation state and the magnetic phase of the bulk structure. Taking into account this dependence, in turn, affects the computed defect formation energies and the predicted strain- and/or defect-induced magnetic phase transitions, especially when occupied localized states appear in the band gap of the material upon defect creation.},

  abstract = {A density matrix formulation of the super-CI MCSCF method is presented. The MC expansion is assumed to be complete in an active subset of the orbital space, and the corresponding CI secular problem is solved by a direct scheme using the unitary group approach. With a density matrix formulation the orbital optimization step becomes independent of the size of the CI expansion. It is possible to formulate the super-CI in terms of density matrices defined only in the small active subspace; the doubly occupied orbitals (the inactive subspace) do not enter. Further, in the unitary group formalism it is straightforward and simple to obtain the necessary density matrices from the symbolic formula list. It then becomes possible to treat very long MC expansions, the largest so far comprising 726 configurations. The method is demonstrated in a calculation of the potential curves for the three lowest states (1Σ+g, 3Σ+u and 3Πg) of the N2 molecule, using a medium-sized gaussian basis set. Seven active orbitals were used yielding the following results: De: 8.76 (9.90), 2.43 (3.68) and 3.39 (4.90) eV; re: 1.108 (1.098), 1.309 (1.287) and 1.230 (1.213) Å; ωe: 2333 (2359), 1385 (1461) and 1680 (1733) cm−1, for the three states (experimental values within parentheses). The results of these calculations indicate that it is important to consider not only the dissociation limit but also the united atom limit in partitioning the occupied orbital space into an active and an inactive part.},

  abstract = {State-of-the-art methods for calculating neutral excitation energies are typically demanding and limited to single electron-hole pairs and their composite plasmons. Here we introduce excitonic density-functional theory (XDFT) a computationally light, generally applicable, first-principles technique for calculating neutral excitations based on generalized constrained DFT. In order to simulate an M-particle excited state of an N-electron system, XDFT automatically optimizes a constraining potential to confine N-M electrons within the ground-state Kohn-Sham valence subspace. We demonstrate the efficacy of XDFT by calculating the lowest single-particle singlet and triplet excitation energies of the well-known Thiel molecular test set, with results which are in excellent agreement with time-dependent DFT. Furthermore, going beyond the capability of adiabatic time-dependent DFT, we show that XDFT can successfully capture double excitations. Overall our method makes optical gaps, excition bindings and oscillator strengths readily accessible at a computational cost comparable to that of standard DFT. As such, XDFT appears as an ideal candidate to work within high-throughput discovery frameworks and within linear-scaling methods for large systems.},

We demonstrate that for strict localization constraints, especially with small localization regions, there can be non-negligible Pulay forces that must be calculated as a correction to the Hellmann-Feynman forces in the ground state. Geometry optimization calculations, which rely heavily upon accurate evaluation of the total ionic forces, show much better convergence when Pulay forces are included. The more conventional case, where the local orbitals remain fixed to pseudo-atomic orbital multiple-ζ basis sets, also benefits from this implementation. We have validated the method on several test cases, including a DNA fragment with 1045 atoms.}

  abstract = {A large number of studies can be found in the literature regarding the production of new catalysts for methanol steam reforming. This work summarizes the latest developments on catalysts for this application and is divided in two main groups: copper-based and group 8–10 metal-based catalysts. In each section, the strategies proposed by several authors to enhance the performance of the catalysts are described. An overall comparison between the two groups shows that copper-based catalysts are the most active ones, while the 8–10 group catalysts present better results in terms of thermal stability and long-term stability. Very promising results were reported for both groups, enhancing the value of methanol as a hydrogen carrier for fuel cell applications.}

Furthermore a brief overview on the reactor types as the most effective component of the theoretical and experimental reported results on the process improvement is given.

Here we show the detailed properties of the H-bonds associated with the Mn4CaO5 cluster using a quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical approach. When O4 is taken as a μ-hydroxo bridge acting as a hydrogen-bond donor to water539 (W539), the S0 redox state best describes the unusually short O4-OW539 distance (2.5\,Å) seen in the crystal structure. We find that in S1, O4 easily releases the proton into a chain of eight strongly hydrogen-bonded water molecules. The corresponding hydrogen-bond network is absent for O5 in S1. The present study suggests that the O4-water chain could facilitate the initial deprotonation event in PSII. This unexpected insight is likely to be of real relevance to mechanistic models for water oxidation.},

  abstract = {Photosynthetic water oxidation performed at the Mn4CaO5 cluster in photosystem II plays a crucial role in energy production as electron and proton sources necessary for CO2 fixation. Molecular oxygen, a byproduct, is a source of the oxygenic atmosphere that sustains life on earth. However, the molecular mechanism of water oxidation is not yet well- understood. In the reaction cycle of intermediates called S states, the S2→S3 transition is particularly important; it consists of multiple processes of electron transfer, proton release, and water insertion, and generates an intermediate leading to O−O bond formation. In this study, we monitored the reaction process during the S2 → S3 transition using time-resolved infrared spectroscopy to clarify its molecular mechanism. A change in the hydrogen-bond interaction of the oxidized YZ • radical, an immediate electron acceptor of the Mn4CaO5 cluster, was clearly observed as a ∼100 μs phase before the electron-transfer phase with a time constant of ∼350 μs. This observation provides strong experimental evidence that rearrangement of the hydrogen-bond network around YZ •, possibly due to the movement of a water molecule located near YZ • to the Mn site, takes place before the electron transfer. The electron transfer was coupled with proton release, as revealed by a relatively high deuterium kinetic isotope effect of 1.9. This proton release, which decreases the redox potential of the Mn4CaO5 cluster to facilitate electron transfer to YZ •, was proposed to determine, as a rate- limiting step, the relatively slow electron-transfer rate of the S2 → S3 transition.}

In 1981, Perdew and Zunger (PZ) subtracted the fully nonlocal self-interaction error orbital-by-orbital, making the corrected functional exact for all collections of separated one-electron densities and making no correction to the exact functional. Although the PZ self-interaction correction (SIC) eliminates many errors of semilocal functionals, it is often worse for equilibrium properties of sp-bonded molecules and solids. Nonempirical semilocal functionals are usually designed to be exact for electron gases of uniform density and, thus, also make 0\% error for neutral atoms in the limit of large atomic number Z, but PZ SIC is not so designed. For localized SIC orbitals, we show analytically that the local spin density approximation (LSDA)-SIC correlation energy per electron of the uniform gas in the high-density limit makes an error of −50\% in the spin-unpolarized case and −100\% in the fully spin-polarized case. Then we extrapolate from the Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe atoms to estimate the relative errors of the PZ SIC exchange-correlation energies (with localized SIC orbitals) in the limit of large atomic number: about +5.5\% for the LSDA-SIC and about −3.5\% for nonempirical generalized gradient [Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE)-SIC] and meta-generalized gradient strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN)-SIC approximations. The SIC errors are considerably larger than those that have been estimated for LSDA-SIC by approximating the localized SIC orbitals for the uniform gas and may explain the errors of PZ SIC for equilibrium properties, opening the door to a generalized SIC that is more widely accurate.},

Plutonium undergoes a 25 per cent increase in volume4 when transformed from its α-phase (which is stable below 400\,K) to the δ-phase (stable at around 600\,K), an effect that is crucial for issues of long-term storage and disposal. It has long been suspected that this unique property is a consequence of the special location of plutonium in the periodic table, on the border between the light and heavy actinides—here, electron wave–particle duality (or itinerant versus localized behaviour) is important5. This situation has resisted previous theoretical treatment. Here we report an electronic structure method, based on dynamical mean-field theory, that enables interpolation between the band-like and atomic-like behaviour of the electron. Our approach enables us to study the phase diagram of plutonium, by providing access to the energetics and one-electron spectra of strongly correlated systems. We explain the origin of the volume expansion between the α- and δ-phases, predict the existence of a strong quasiparticle peak near the Fermi level and give a new viewpoint on the physics of plutonium, in which the α- and δ-phases are on opposite sides of the interaction-driven localization–delocalization transition.},

We demonstrate that while SR calculations have higher random errors, FR calculations systematically underestimate the VIP by 0.1 to 0.2 eV. We further verify that SOC effects may be well approximated at the FR density functional level and then added to SR G0W0 results for a broad class of systems. We also address the use of different root-finding algorithms for the G0W0 quasiparticle equation and the significant influence of including d electrons in the valence partition of the pseudopotential for G0W0 calculations.

Extreme temperature and pressure conditions accelerate peptidization greatly compared to the ambient bulk water environment and are shown to favor, in general, concerted versus stepwise mechanisms. Finally, a pyrite surface, FeS2 (001), is found to lower reaction barriers further by decreasing fluctuations and by assisting the preformation of the cyclic five-membered NCA ring due to scaffolding.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive study of free energy landscapes and mechanisms of COS-mediated polymerization of glycine via N-carboxy anhydrides (NCAs, “Leuchs anhydrides”) and peptide hydrolysis at the water–pyrite interface at extreme thermodynamic conditions is presented. Particular emphasis is set on the catalytic effects of the mineral surface including the putative role of the ubiquitous sulfur vacancy defects. It is found that the mere presence of a surface is able to change the free energetics of the elementary reaction steps. This effect can be understood in terms of a reduction of entropic contributions to the reactant state by immobilizing the reactants and/or screening them from bulk water in a purely geometric (“steric”) sense. Additionally, the pyrite directly participates chemically in some of the reaction steps, thus changing the reaction mechanism qualitatively compared to the situation in bulk water. First, the adsorption of reactants on the surface can preform a product-like structure due to immobilizing and scaffolding them appropriately. Second, pyrite can act as a proton acceptor, thus replacing water in this role. Third, sulfur vacancies are found to increase the reactivity of the surface. The finding that the presence of pyrite speeds up the rate-determining step in the formation of peptides with respect to the situation in bulk solvent while stabilizing the produced peptide against hydrolysis is of particular interest to the hypothesis of prebiotic peptide formation at hydrothermal aqueous conditions. Apart from these implications, the generality of the studied organic reactions are of immediate relevance to many fields such as (bio)geochemistry, biomineralization, and environmental chemistry.},

Binding and modification of the water molecules that are substrates of the water-oxidation reaction is mechanistically crucial but controversially debated. Two recent crystal structures of the OEC in its highest oxidation state (S3) show either a vacant Mn coordination site or a bound peroxide species. For purified PSII at room temperature, we collected Mn Kα X-ray emission spectra of the S0, S1, S2, and S3 intermediates in the OEC cycle, which were analyzed by comparison to synthetic Mn compounds, spectral simulations, and OEC models from density functional theory.

It is shown that the G0W0 approximation always yields too small band gaps. To improve agreement with experiment, the eigenvalues in the Green’s function G (GW0) and in the Green’s function and the dielectric matrix (GW) are updated until self-consistency is reached. The first approximation leads to excellent agreement with experiment, whereas an update of the eigenvalues in G and W gives too large band gaps for virtually all materials. From a pragmatic point of view, the GW0 approximation thus seems to be an accurate and still reasonably fast method for predicting quasiparticle energies in simple sp-bonded systems. We furthermore observe that the band gaps in materials with shallow d states (GaAs, GaN, and ZnO) are systematically underestimated. We propose that an inaccurate description of the static dielectric properties of these materials is responsible for the underestimation of the band gaps in GW0, which is itself a result of the incomplete cancellation of the Hartree self-energy within the d shell by local or gradient corrected density functionals.},

We ascribe this limited predictive power of the DFT+U method, parameterized via LR, to the absence of corrections of Coulomb interactions between the electrons with opposite spins. Using the recently proposed extended DFT+U+U↑↓ functional, which includes the aforementioned corrections, we show how redox potentials of Ni- and V-based compounds could be calculated in a much better agreement with experiment, also proposing a procedure of parameterization of such calculations.

  abstract = {The use of the local approximation for the exchange and correlation energy within the density-functional formalism has proven to be much more successful than originally anticipated. The calculation of the ground state for weakly bound negative ions, such as H-, provides a sensitive test of the local approximation, which is known to lead to an incorrect asymptotic form of the single-particle effective potential. For H-, the result is a qualitatively incorrect ground state, the electrons being partially delocalized. We show how this problem may be corrected by constraining the electrons with a fictitious spherical barrier at a large radius. For H- we use this procedure to obtain a ground-state energy of -0.518 a.u. and an electronic affinity for H of -0.92 eV. © 1977 The American Physical Society.}

In the present study the two final S-transitions of water oxidation are studied. The electron coupled proton transfers are followed from the center of the OEC to Asp61\{,\} which is considered as the start of the transfer chain through the protein to the lumenal side. It is found that the proton transfers occur in multiple steps. Structures of intermediates and energy diagrams are derived and compared to experimental observations. Since the new experimental structure of the OEC is very similar to the one suggested earlier by density functional calculations\{,\} the O-O bond formation step remains essentially the same as the one suggested five years ago. An interesting new result is that the barrier for proton transfer within the OEC actually competes with the O-O bond formation step of being rate-limiting.}

  abstract = {Detailed mechanisms for substrate water exchange in the oxygen evolving complex in photosystem II have been determined with DFT methods for large models. Existing interpretations of the experimental water exchange results have been quite different. By many groups, these results have been the main argument against the water oxidation mechanism suggested by DFT, in which the oxygen molecule is formed between a bridging oxo and an oxyl radical ligand in the center of the OEC. That mechanism is otherwise in line with most experiments. The problem has been that the mechanism requires a rather fast exchange of a bridging oxo ligand, which is not a common finding for smaller Mn-containing model systems. However, other groups have actually favored a substrate derived oxo ligand partly based on the same experiments. In the present study, three S-states have been studied, and the rates have been well reproduced by the calculations. The surprising experimental finding that water exchange in S1 is slower than the one in S2 is reproduced and explained. The key to this rate difference is the ease by which one of the manganese centers (Mn3) is reduced. This reduction has to occur to release the substrate water from Mn3. The similar rate of the slow exchange in S2 and S3 has been rationalized on the basis of earlier experiments combined with the present calculations. The results strongly support the previous DFT-suggested water oxidation mechanism.},

One of them concerns the charge and the protonation state of the oxygen evolving complex (OEC). Previously\{,\} theory and experiments have agreed that the two water derived ligands on the outer manganese should be one hydroxide and one water. In the present study it is investigated whether both of them could be water. This question is addressed by a detailed study of energy diagrams\{,\} but in this context it is more conclusive to compare the redox potential of the OEC to the one of TyrZ. Both procedures lead to the conclusion that one of the ligands is a hydroxide. Another question concerns the protonation of the second shell His337\{,\} where the results are more ambiguous. The final part of the present study describes results when calcium is removed from the OEC. Even though protons enter to compensate the charge of the missing Ca2+\{,\} the redox potential and the pKa value of the OEC change dramatically and prevent the progress after S2.}

In the present short paper, the six most reasonable versions of the latter mechanism have been studied and compared with the oxo-oxyl mechanism. The barriers are found to be much too high for the water attack, and that mechanism can therefore safely be ruled out. The reason is that the protonated peroxide product is always very high in energy.},

The excitation energy corresponding to the transfer of an electron at any given ionic configuration (the Marcus energy gap) is accurately assessed within ground-state density-functional theory via a novel penalty functional for oxidation-reduction reactions that appropriately acts on the electronic degrees of freedom alone. The self-interaction error intrinsic to common exchange-correlation functionals is also corrected by the same penalty functional. The diabatic free-energy surfaces are then constructed from umbrella sampling on large ensembles of configurations.

  abstract = {We present a method for obtaining well-localized Wannier-like functions (WF’s) for energy bands that are attached to or mixed with other bands. The present scheme removes the limitation of the usual maximally localized WF’s method [N. Marzari and D. Vanderbilt, Phys. Rev. B 56, 12 847 (1997)] that the bands of interest should form an isolated group, separated by gaps from higher and lower bands everywhere in the Brillouin zone. An energy window encompassing N bands of interest is specified by the user, and the algorithm then proceeds to disentangle these from the remaining bands inside the window by filtering out an optimally connected N-dimensional subspace. This is achieved by minimizing a functional that measures the subspace dispersion across the Brillouin zone. The maximally localized WF’s for the optimal subspace are then obtained via the algorithm of Marzari and Vanderbilt. The method, which functions as a postprocessing step using the output of conventional electronic-structure codes, is applied to the s and d bands of copper, and to the valence and low-lying conduction bands of silicon. For the low-lying nearly-free-electron bands of copper we find WF’s which are centered at the tetrahedral-interstitial sites, suggesting an alternative tight-binding parametrization.},

Combined with the fractional-charge correction from recently developed localized orbital scaling correction (LOSC), a functional, the fractional-spin LOSC (FSLOSC), is proposed. FSLOSC, a correction to commonly used functional approximations, introduces the explicit derivative discontinuity and largely restores the flat-plane behavior of electronic energy at fractional charges and fractional spins. In addition to improving results from conventional functionals for the prediction of ionization potentials, electron affinities, quasiparticle spectra, and reaction barrier heights, FSLOSC properly describes the dissociation of ionic species, single bonds, and multiple bonds without breaking space or spin symmetry and corrects the spurious fractional-charge dissociation of heteroatom molecules of conventional functionals. Thus, FSLOSC demonstrates success in reducing delocalization error and including strong correlation, within low-cost density functional approximation.},

  abstract = {Symmetry is a fundamental concept that plays a critical role in many chemical and physical phenomena and processes, which highlights the importance of theoretical methods to correctly handle symmetry. The recently developed localized orbital scaling correction (LOSC1) shows great improvement on the description of band gaps, photoemission spectra, and dissociation limits of cationic species. However, issues remain with LOSC1 in dealing with the symmetry and degeneracy of electronic states, which are also relevant to other methods using localization. In this work, we utilize a new method that deals with the physical-space and the energy-space localization on an equal footing. The resulting localized orbitals, i.e., orbitalets, are able to maintain more symmetry and the desired state degeneracy, which is important in calculating the electronic structure of both molecules and periodic bulk systems. Furthermore, the curvature matrix is redefined to improve potential energy curves for systems with stretched bonds, while retaining the correct dissociation limits. This new approach, termed LOSC2, includes only two fitting parameters. It maintains accuracy similar to that of LOSC1 over many properties, while overcoming LOSC1’s deficiencies in symmetry and degeneracy. Our tests have shown that LOSC2 orbitalets possess the full- or subgroup of molecular symmetry if allowed, which preserves the state degeneracy. Tests on differently sized planar annulenes, odd-numbered allenes, and triphenylene again verify that LOSC2 is able to maintain the state degeneracy, while LOSC1 cannot. All the tests demonstrate the advantage of LOSC2 in the calculation of molecular systems and its potential for application to periodic bulk systems.},

No insertion of water was found in S2, but flipping of D1 Glu189 upon transition to S3 leads to the opening of a water channel and provides a space for incorporation of an additional oxygen ligand, resulting in an open cubane Mn4CaO6 cluster with an oxyl/oxo bridge. Structural changes of PSII between the different S states reve cooperative action of substrate water access, proton release, and dioxygen formation in photosynthetic water oxidation.}

We have thus analyzed the exchange energy of the inhomogeneous electron gas to third order in the deviation from a constant density. We give the symmetry properties obeyed by the corresponding second-order response function Lx, and demonstrate how Lx gives rise to gradient corrections to the exchange energy. The expansion, which is taken up to sixth order in the density gradient, also includes the Laplacian of the density. In the case of a statically screened Coulomb interaction, we have calculated the coefficients of second- and fourth-order gradient terms both analytically and numerically. In analogy with the corresponding results from linear-response theory, the fourth-order coefficient is shown to diverge as the screening is made to vanish. For the bare Coulomb interaction we have not succeeded in obtaining analytical results, and, due to numerical problems at small-q vectors, our numerically obtained coefficients have an estimated uncertainty of 20\%.},

Our precise measurement of the Fermi surface confirms the importance of spin-orbit coupling in this material and reveals that its effective value is enhanced by a factor of about 2, due to electronic correlations. The self-energies for the β and γ sheets are found to display significant angular dependence. By taking into account the multi-orbital composition of quasiparticle states, we determine self-energies associated with each orbital component directly from the experimental data. This analysis demonstrates that the perceived angular dependence does not imply momentum-dependent many-body effects but arises from a substantial orbital mixing induced by spin-orbit coupling. A comparison to single-site dynamical mean-field theory further supports the notion of dominantly local orbital self-energies and provides strong evidence for an electronic origin of the observed nonlinear frequency dependence of the self-energies, leading to “kinks” in the quasiparticle dispersion of Sr2RuO4.},

  abstract = {Density Functional Theory (DFT) computational studies of the Mn4/Ca Oxygen Evolving Complex (OEC) region of Photosystem II in the paramagnetic S2 and S3 states of the water oxdizing catalytic cycle are described. These build upon recent advances in computationally understanding the detailed S1 state OEC geometries, revealed by the recent high resolution Photosystem II crystal structures of Shen et al., at 1.90Å and 1.95Å (Petrie et al., 2015, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 54, 7120). The models feature a ‘Low Oxidation Paradigm’ assumption for the mean Mn oxidation states in the functional enzyme, with the mean oxidation levels being 3.0, 3.25 and 3.5 in S1, S2 and S3, respectively. These calculations are used to infer magnetic exchange interactions within the coupled OEC cluster, particularly in the Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR)-visible S2 and S3 states. Detailed computational estimates of the intrinsic magnitudes and molecular orientations of the 55Mn hyperfine tensors in the S2 state are presented. These parameters, together with the resultant spin projected hyperfine values are compared with recent appropriate experimental EPR data (Continuous Wave (CW), Electron-Nuclear Double Resonance (ENDOR) and ELDOR (Electron-Electron Double Resonance)-Detected Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (EDNMR)) from the OEC. It is found that an effective Coupled Dimer magnetic organization of the four Mn in the OEC cluster in the S2 and S3 states is able to quantitatively rationalize the observed 55Mn hyperfine data. This is consistent with structures we propose to represent the likely state of the OEC in the catalytically active form of the enzyme.},

Among them, the semilocal potentials are particularly interesting for large systems since they lead to calculations that are much faster than with hybrid functionals or methods like GW. We present an exhaustive comparison of semilocal exchange-correlation potentials for band gap calculations on a large test set of solids, and particular attention is paid to the potential HLE16 proposed by Verma and Truhlar. It is shown that the most accurate potential is the modified Becke–Johnson potential, which, most noticeably, is much more accurate than all other semilocal potentials for strongly correlated systems. This can be attributed to its additional dependence on the kinetic energy density. It is also shown that the modified Becke–Johnson potential is at least as accurate as the hybrid functionals and more reliable for solids with large band gaps.}

  abstract = {Computational catalysis and machine learning communities have made considerable progress in developing machine learning models for catalyst discovery and design. Yet, a general machine learning potential that spans the chemical space of catalysis is still out of reach. A significant hurdle is obtaining access to training data across a wide range of materials. One important class of materials where data is lacking are oxides, which inhibits models from studying the Oxygen Evolution Reaction and oxide electrocatalysis more generally. To address this we developed the Open Catalyst 2022(OC22) dataset, consisting of 62,521 Density Functional Theory (DFT) relaxations (\textasciitilde 9,884,504 single point calculations) across a range of oxide materials, coverages, and adsorbates (*H, *O, *N, *C, *OOH, *OH, *OH2, *O2, *CO). We define generalized tasks to predict the total system energy that are applicable across catalysis, develop baseline performance of several graph neural networks (SchNet, DimeNet++, ForceNet, SpinConv, PaiNN, GemNet-dT, GemNet-OC), and provide pre-defined dataset splits to establish clear benchmarks for future efforts. For all tasks, we study whether combining datasets leads to better results, even if they contain different materials or adsorbates. Specifically, we jointly train models on Open Catalyst 2020 (OC20) Dataset and OC22, or fine-tune pretrained OC20 models on OC22. In the most general task, GemNet-OC sees a \textasciitilde 32\% improvement in energy predictions through fine-tuning and a \textasciitilde 9\% improvement in force predictions via joint training. Surprisingly, joint training on both the OC20 and much smaller OC22 datasets also improves total energy predictions on OC20 by \textasciitilde 19\%. The dataset and baseline models are open sourced, and a public leaderboard will follow to encourage continued community developments on the total energy tasks and data.},

  abstract = {The existence of band gaps in both the antiferromagnetic (AFM) and paramagnetic (PM) phases of the classic NaCl-structure Mott insulators MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO is traditionally viewed and taught as a manifestation of strong correlation whereby insulation results from electrons moving across the lattice forming states with doubly occupied d orbitals on certain atomic sites and empty d orbitals on other sites. Within such theories, the gap of the AFM and PM phases of these oxides emerges even in the absence of spatial symmetry breaking. The need for such a correlated picture is partially based on the known failure of the commonly used band models for the PM phase that assume for such a spin disordered state the macroscopically averaged NaCl structure, where all transition metal (TM) sites are symmetry-equivalent (a monomorphous description), producing a gapless PM state with zero magnetic moments, in sharp conflict with experiment. Here, we seek to understand the minimum theoretical description needed to capture the leading descriptors of ground state Mott insulation in the classic, 3d monoxide Mott systems—gapping and moment formation in the AFM and PM phase. As noted by previous authors, the spin-ordered AFM phase in these materials already shows in band theory a significant band gap when one doubles the NaCl unit cell by permitting different potentials for transition-metal atoms with different spins. For the spin-disordered PM phase, we allow analogously larger NaCl-type supercells where each TM site can have different spin direction and local bonding environments (i.e., disordered), yet the total spin is zero. Such a polymorphous description has the flexibility to acquire symmetry-breaking energy-lowering patterns that can lift the degeneracy of the d orbitals and develop large on-site magnetic moments without violating the global, averaged NaCl symmetry. Electrons are exchanged between spin-up and spin-down bands to create closed-shell insulating configurations that lend themselves to a single determinental description. It turns out that such a polymorphous description of the structure within the single-determinant, mean-field, Bloch periodic band structure approach (based on DFT+U) allows large on-site magnetic moments to develop spontaneously, leading to significant (1–3 eV) band gaps and large local moments in the AFM and PM phases of the classic NaCl-structure Mott insulators MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO in agreement with experiment. We adapt to the spin disordered polymorphous configurations the “special quasirandom structure” (SQS) construct known from the theory of disordered substitutional alloys whereby supercell approximants which represent the best random configuration average (not individual snapshots) for finite (64, 216 atoms, or larger) supercells of a given lattice symmetry are constructed. We conclude that the basic features of these paradigmatic Mott insulators can be approximated by the physics included in energy-lowering symmetry broken DFT.},

The response functions entering the ACFD theorem are approximated here by the direct random phase approximation (dRPA). For a set of prototypical semiconductors and insulators it is shown that even with this quite drastic approximation the resulting band gaps are very close to experiment and of a similar quality to those from the computationally more involved GW approximation. By going beyond the dRPA in the future the accuracy of the calculated band gaps may be significantly improved further.},

Important details of its mechanism are not well understood. In order to understand the mechanism of water splitting, we perform here large-scale density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the active site of PSII in different oxidation, spin and ligand states. Prior to formation of the O-O bond, we find that all manganese atoms are oxidized to Mn(IV) in the S3 state, consistent with earlier studies. We find here, however, that the formation of the S3 state is coupled to the movement of a calcium-bound hydroxide (W3) from the Ca to a Mn (Mn1 or Mn4) in a process that is triggered by the formation of a tyrosyl radical (Tyr-161) and its protonated base, His-190. We find that subsequent oxidation and deprotonation of this hydroxide on Mn1 result in formation of an oxyl-radical that can exergonically couple with one of the oxo-bridges (O5), forming an O-O bond. When O2 leaves the active site, a second Ca-bound water molecule reorients to bridge the gap between the manganese ions Mn1 and Mn4, forming a new oxo-bridge for the next reaction cycle. Our findings are consistent with experimental data, and suggest that the calcium ion may control substrate water access to the water oxidation sites.}

Although the generalized gradient approximations yield improved energies compared to the local-density approximation, the exchange and correlation potentials (especially the latter) obtained from the generalized gradient approximations are in poor agreement with the corresponding exact potentials. The large-distance asymptotic behavior of the exact exchange-correlation potential to O(1/r4) is found to agree with theoretical predictions. The short-range behavior of the exchange-correlation potential is very close to quadratic. The prospects for improved generalized gradient approximations are discussed.},

PSII consists of 19 or 20 subunits in its crystal form and binds various cofactors such as chlorophyll a, plastoquinone, carotenoid, and lipids. After initial light excitation, the charge separation produces an electron, which is transferred to a plastoquinone molecule (QA) and then to another plastoquinone (QB). PsbM is a low-molecular-weight subunit with one transmembrane helix, and is located in the monomer-monomer interface of the PSII dimer. The function of PsbM has been reported to be stabilization of the PSII dimer and maintenance of electron transfer efficiency of PSII based on previous X-ray crystal structure analysis at a resolution of 4.2 Å. In order to elucidate the structure-function relationships of PsbM in detail, we improved the quality of PSII crystals from a PsbM-deleted mutant (ΔPsbM-PSII) of Thermosynechococcus elongatus, and succeeded in improving the diffraction quality to a resolution of 2.2 Å. X-ray crystal structure analysis of ΔPsbM-PSII showed that electron densities for the PsbM subunit and neighboring carotenoid and detergent molecules were absent in the monomer-monomer interface. The overall structure of ΔPsbM-PSII was similar with wild-type PSII, but the arrangement of the hydrophobic transmembrane subunits was significantly changed by the deletion of PsbM, resulting in a slight widening of the lipid hole involving QB. The lipid hole-widening further induced structural changes of the bicarbonate ion coordinated to the non-heme Fe(II) atom and destabilized the polypeptide chains around the QB binding site located far from the position of PsbM. The fluorescence decay measurement indicated that the electron transfer rate from QA to QB was decreased in ΔPsbM-PSII compared to wild-type PSII. The functional change in electron transfer efficiency was fully interpreted based on structural changes caused by the deletion of the PsbM subunit.},

  abstract = {First-principles calculations in crystalline structures are often performed with a planewave basis set. To make the number of basis functions tractable two approximations are usually introduced: core electrons are frozen and the diverging Coulomb potential near the nucleus is replaced by a smoother expression. The norm-conserving pseudopotential was the first successful method to apply these approximations in a fully ab initio way. Later on, more efficient and more exact approaches were developed based on the ultrasoft and the projector augmented wave formalisms. These formalisms are however more complex and developing new features in these frameworks is usually more difficult than in the norm-conserving framework. Most of the existing tables of norm-conserving pseudopotentials, generated long ago, do not include the latest developments, are not systematically tested or are not designed primarily for high precision. In this paper, we present our PseudoDojo framework for developing and testing full tables of pseudopotentials, and demonstrate it with a new table generated with the ONCVPSP approach. The PseudoDojo is an open source project, building on the AbiPy package, for developing and systematically testing pseudopotentials. At present it contains 7 different batteries of tests executed with ABINIT, which are performed as a function of the energy cutoff. The results of these tests are then used to provide hints for the energy cutoff for actual production calculations. Our final set contains 141 pseudopotentials split into a standard and a stringent accuracy table. In total around 70,000 calculations were performed to test the pseudopotentials. The process of developing the final table led to new insights into the effects of both the core-valence partitioning and the non-linear core corrections on the stability, convergence, and transferability of norm-conserving pseudopotentials. The PseudoDojo hence provides a set of pseudopotentials and general purpose tools for further testing and development, focusing on highly accurate calculations and their use in the development of ab initio packages. The pseudopotential files are available on the PseudoDojo web-interface pseudo-dojo.org under the name NC (ONCVPSP) v0.4 in the psp8, UPF2, and PSML 1.1 formats. The webinterface also provides the inputs, which are compatible with the 3.3.1 and higher versions of ONCVPSP. All tests have been performed with ABINIT 8.4.},

Their insulating character and structural distortions are often ascribed to dynamical electronic correlations within a universal, symmetry-conserving paradigm. This view restricts predictive theory to complex computational schemes, going beyond density functional theory (DFT). Here, we show that, if one allows symmetry-breaking energy-lowering crystal symmetry reductions and electronic instabilities within DFT, one successfully and systematically recovers the trends in the observed band gaps, magnetic moments, type of magnetic and crystallographic ground state, bond disproportionation and ligand hole effects, Mott vs. charge transfer insulator behaviors, and the amplitude of structural deformation modes including Jahn-Teller in low temperature spin-ordered and high temperature disordered paramagnetic phases. We then provide a classification of the four mechanisms of gap formation and establish DFT as a reliable base platform to study the ground state properties in complex oxides.},

The electronic structures of these isomers are known, but their role in the catalytic cycle of water oxidation remains unclear. We show that formation of the S = 1/2 state from the S = 5/2 state is exergonic at temperatures above 160 K. However, the S = 1/2 isomer decays to S1 more slowly than the S = 5/2 isomer. These differences support the hypotheses that the S3 state is formed via the S2 state S = 5/2 isomer and that the stabilized S2 state S = 1/2 isomer plays a role in minimizing S2QA– decay under light-limiting conditions.}

At the same time, high-throughput (HT) computational materials design is an emergent field that promises to accelerate reliable and cost-effective design and optimisation of new materials with target properties. The use of MLWFs in HT workflows has been hampered by the fact that generating MLWFs automatically and robustly without any user intervention and for arbitrary materials is, in general, very challenging. We address this problem directly by proposing a procedure for automatically generating MLWFs for HT frameworks. Our approach is based on the selected columns of the density matrix method and we present the details of its implementation in an AiiDA workflow. We apply our approach to a dataset of 200 bulk crystalline materials that span a wide structural and chemical space. We assess the quality of our MLWFs in terms of the accuracy of the band-structure interpolation that they provide as compared to the band-structure obtained via full first-principles calculations. Finally, we provide a downloadable virtual machine that can be used to reproduce the results of this paper, including all first-principles and atomistic simulations as well as the computational workflows.},

In this article, we take a new look at the deviation from linearity (i.e., curvature) in the solid-state limit by considering two different ways of approaching it: a large finite system of increasing size and a crystal represented by an increasingly large reference cell with periodic boundary conditions. We show that the curvature approaches vanishing values in both limits, even for functionals which yield poor predictions of electronic structure, and therefore cannot be used as a diagnostic or constructive tool in solids. We find that the approach towards zero curvature is different in each of the two limits, owing to the presence of a compensating backgroun...},

Here we show for the first time by means of first-principles computations that charge carriers can spontaneously localize due to a purely electronic effect in otherwise perfectly ordered structures. Optimally tuned range-separated density functional theory and many-body perturbation calculations within the GW approximation reveal that in trans-polyacetylene and polythiophene the hole density localizes on a length scale of several nanometers. This is due to exchange-induced translational symmetry breaking of the charge density. Ionization potentials, optical absorption peaks, excitonic binding energies, and the optimally tuned range parameter itself all become independent of polymer length as it exceeds the critical localization length. Moreover, we find that lattice disorder and the formation of a polaron result from the charge localization in contrast to the traditional view that lattice distortions precede charge localization. Our results can explain experimental findings that polarons in conjugated polymers form instantaneously after exposure to ultrafast light pulses.},

  abstract = {Understanding structure−function relations in photosystem II (PSII) is important for the development of biomimetic photocatalytic systems. X-ray crystallography, computational modeling, and spectroscopy have played central roles in elucidating the structure and function of PSII. Recent breakthroughs in femtosecond X-ray crystallography offer the possibility of collecting diffraction data from the X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) before radiation damage of the sample, thereby overcoming the main challenge of conventional X-ray diffraction methods. However, the interpretation of XFEL data from PSII intermediates is challenging because of the issues regarding data-processing, uncertainty on the precise positions of light oxygen atoms next to heavy metal centers, and different kinetics of the S-state transition in microcrystals compared to solution. Here, we summarize recent advances and outstanding challenges in PSII structure−function determination with emphasis on the implementation of quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics techniques combined with isomorphous difference Fourier maps, direct methods, and high-resolution spectroscopy. P hotosystem II (PSII) is the only known protein complex capable of catalyzing direct solar water-splitting into O 2 , protons, and electrons. 1−4 Understanding its structure− function relations can provide fundamental insights, essential for the design of artificial photosynthetic systems. The oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) of PSII is a CaMn 4 O 5 oxo-manganese cofactor that binds substrate water and splits it into O 2 , protons, and electrons through a stepwise catalytic cycle (Figure 1). During each turn of the cycle, the OEC evolves through five " storage " states, S n (n = 0−4), where S 1 is the dark stable state while S 0 and S 4 are the most reduced and oxidized forms, respectively. 5,6},

  abstract = {Single-atom catalysis has arguably become the most active new frontier in heterogeneous catalysis. Aided by recent advances in practical synthetic methodologies, characterization techniques and computational modelling, we now have a large number of single-atom catalysts (SACs) that exhibit distinctive performances for a wide variety of chemical reactions. This Perspective summarizes recent experimental and computational efforts aimed at understanding the bonding in SACs and how this relates to catalytic performance. The examples described here illustrate the utility of SACs in a broad scope of industrially important reactions and highlight the advantages these catalysts have over those presently used. SACs have well-defined active centres, such that unique opportunities exist for the rational design of new catalysts with high activities, selectivities and stabilities. Indeed, given a certain practical application, we can often design a suitable SAC; thus, the field has developed very rapidly and afforded promising catalyst leads. Moreover, the control we have over certain SAC structures paves the way for designing base metal catalysts with the activities of noble metal catalysts. It appears that we are entering a new era of heterogeneous catalysis in which we have control over well-dispersed single-atom active sites whose properties we can readily tune.},

A conjugate gradient scheme can then be used to find the ground state orbitals from the minimization of a sequence of transformed unconstrained electronic energy functionals. The technique provides an efficient, robust, and numerically stable approach to direct total energy minimization in first principles electronic structure theory based on tight-binding, Hartree–Fock, or density functional theory.

This combination of methods explicitly accounts for dynamical and multireference quantum physics, such as valence and spin fluctuations, of the 3d electrons, while treating a significant proportion of the protein (more than 1,000 atoms) with DFT. The computed electronic structure of the myoglobin complexes and the nature of the Fe--O2 bonding are validated against experimental spectroscopic observables. We elucidate and solve a long-standing problem related to the quantum-mechanical description of the respiration process, namely that DFT calculations predict a strong imbalance between O2 and CO binding, favoring the latter to an unphysically large extent. We show that the explicit inclusion of the many-body effects induced by the Hund\{\textbackslash rq\}s coupling mechanism results in the correct prediction of similar binding energies for oxy- and carbonmonoxymyoglobin.}

  abstract = {The conventional analysis of Perdew and Levy, and Sham and Schlüter shows that the functional derivative discontinuity of the exchange-correlation density functional plays a critical role in the correct prediction of bandgaps, or the chemical hardness. In a recent work by the present authors, explicit expressions for bandgap prediction with all common types of exchange-correlation functionals have been derived without invoking the concept of exchange-correlation energy functional derivative discontinuity at all. We here analyze the two approaches and establish their connection and difference. The present analysis further leads to several important results: (1) The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) in DFT has as much meaning in describing electron addition as the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) in describing electron removal. (2) Every term in the total energy functional contributes to the energy gap because of the discontinuity of the derivative of the density (or density matrix) with respect to the number of electrons, ((ρ s(r′,r))/N)v s, at integers. (3) Consistent with the Perdew-Levy-Sham-Schlüter conclusion that the exact Kohn-Sham energy gap differs from the fundamental bandgap by a finite correction due to the functional derivative discontinuity of the exchange-correlation energy, we show that the exchange-correlation functional cannot be an explicit and differentiable functional of the electron density, either local or nonlocal. The last result is further strengthened when we consider Mott insulators. There, the exact exchange-correlation functional needs to have an explicitly discontinuous (nondifferentiable) dependence on the density or the density matrix. (4) We obtain exact conditions on the derivatives of total energy with respect to the spin-up and spin-down number of electrons. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.},

The second type of flat-planes condition occurs when the energy has a derivative discontinuity on a line segment where the spin polarization, Nα - Nβ, is an integer, but does not have a discontinuity associated with an integer number of electrons. Type 2 flat planes are rare - we observed just 15 type 2 flat-planes conditions out of the 4884 cases we tested - but their mere existence has implications for the design of exchange-correlation energy density functionals. To facilitate the development of functionals that have the correct behavior with respect to both fractional number of electrons and fractional spin polarization, we present a dataset for the chromium atom and its ions that can be used to test new functionals.},

In this work, by presuming a quantitative correspondence between the quasiparticle energies and the generalized Kohn–Sham orbital energies, and employing a previously developed global scaling correction approach, we achieve substantially improved prediction of molecular quasiparticle and excitation energies. In addition, we also extend our previous study on temporary anions in resonant states, which are associated with negative molecular electron affinities. The proposed approach does not require any explicit self-consistent field calculation on the excited-state species, and is thus highly efficient and convenient for practical purposes.},

PS II, a membrane-bound multi-subunit pigment protein complex, couples the one-electron photochemistry at the reaction centre with the four-electron redox chemistry of water oxidation at the Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster in the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC). Under illumination, the OEC cycles through five intermediate S-states (S 0 to S 4) 1 , in which S 1 is the dark-stable state and S 3 is the last semi-stable state before O–O bond formation and O 2 evolution 2,3 . A detailed understanding of the O–O bond formation mechanism remains a challenge, and will require elucidation of both the structures of the OEC in the different S-states and the binding of the two substrate waters to the catalytic site 4–6 .

  abstract = {In oxygenic photosynthesis, water is oxidized and dioxygen is produced at a Mn 4 Ca complex bound to the proteins of photosystem II (PSII). Valence and coordination changes in its catalytic S-state cycle are of great interest. In room-temperature (in situ) experiments, time-resolved energy-sampling X-ray emission spectroscopy of the Mn Kβ 1,3 line after laser-flash excitation of PSII membrane particles was applied to characterize the redox transitions in the S-state cycle. The Kβ 1,3 line energies suggest a high-valence configuration of the Mn 4 Ca complex with Mn(III) 3 Mn(IV) in S 0 , Mn(III) 2 Mn(IV) 2 in S 1 , Mn(III)Mn(IV) 3 in S 2 , and Mn(IV) 4 in S 3 and, thus, manganese oxidation in each of the three accessible oxidizing transitions of the water-oxidizing complex. There are no indications of formation of a ligand radical, thus rendering partial water oxidation before reaching the S 4 state unlikely. The difference spectra of both manganese Kβ 1,3 emission and K-edge X-ray absorption display different shapes for Mn(III) oxidation in the S 2 → S 3 transition when compared to Mn(III) oxidation in the S 1 → S 2 transition. Comparison to spectra of manganese compounds with known structures and oxidation states and varying metal coordination environments suggests a change in the manganese ligand environment in the S 2 → S 3 transition, which could be oxidation of five-coordinated Mn(III) to six-coordinated Mn(IV). Conceivable options for the rearrangement of (substrate) water species and metal−ligand bonding patterns at the Mn 4 Ca complex in the S 2 → S 3 transition are discussed. T he manganese−calcium complex (Mn 4 Ca) of photo-system II (PSII) is the catalyst of photochemical water oxidation in oxygenic photosynthesis. Driven by the energy of four visible light photons, it facilitates decomposition of two water molecules into four protons and four electrons during the generation of dioxygen (O 2). 1−5 The molecular structure and reaction cycle of the Mn 4 Ca complex inspire synthetic chemists in the development of water oxidation catalysts for solar fuel applications. 6−12 The crystal structure of the Mn 4 Ca complex has been determined at better than 2 Å resolution, 13,14 and impressing progress in the understanding of its reactivity has been achieved. 1−5,9,15−18 The complex includes a Mn 3 CaO 4 cubane cluster, which is (hydr)oxo-bridged to the fourth manganese ion and coordinated by carboxylate groups of glutamic and aspartic amino acids and by a histidine to the protein scaffold (Figure 1). Electron and proton abstraction events, storage and distribution of oxidation equivalents within the Mn 4 Ca complex, and structural changes at the metal center during the catalytic cycle have been much debated, and full consensus still has not been reached. 2−7,9,15−22}

Kinetic lag phases detected in the XAS transients prior to the respective ET steps were assigned to S3+-{$>$}S3n (\textasciitilde 150 µs, H2O; \textasciitilde 380 µs, D2O) and S2+-{$>$}S2n ...},

  abstract = {Light damages photosynthetic machinery, primarily photosystem II (PSII), and it results in photoinhibition. A new photodamage model, the two-step photodamage model, suggests that photodamage to PSII initially occurs at the oxygen evolving complex (OEC) by light energy absorbed by manganese and that the PSII reaction center is subsequently damaged by light energy absorbed by photosynthetic pigments due to the limitation of electrons to the PSII reaction center. However, it is still uncertain whether this model is applicable to photodamage to PSII under visible light as manganese absorbs visible light only weakly. In the present study, we identified the initial site of photodamage to PSII upon illumination of visible light using PSII membrane fragments isolated from spinach leaves. When PSII samples were exposed to visible light in the presence of an exogenous electron acceptor, both PSII total activity and the PSII reaction centre activity declined due to photodamage. The supplemental addition of an electron donor to the PSII reaction centre alleviated the decline of the reaction centre activity but not the PSII total activity upon the light exposure. Our results demonstrate that visible light damages OEC prior to photodamage to the PSII reaction center, consistent with two-step photodamage model.}

  abstract = {Piecewise linearity of the energy with respect to fractional electron removal or addition is a requirement of an electronic structure method that necessitates the presence of a derivative discontinuity at integer electron occupation. Semi-local exchange-correlation (xc) approximations within density functional theory (DFT) fail to reproduce this behavior, giving rise to deviations from linearity with a convex global curvature that is evidence of many-electron, self-interaction error and electron delocalization. Popular functional tuning strategies focus on reproducing piecewise linearity, especially to improve predictions of optical properties. In a divergent approach, Hubbard U-augmented DFT (i.e., DFT+U) treats self-interaction errors by reducing the local curvature of the energy with respect to electron removal or addition from one localized subshell to the surrounding system. Although it has been suggested that DFT+U should simultaneously alleviate global and local curvature in the atomic limit, no detailed study on real systems has been carried out to probe the validity of this statement. In this work, we show when DFT+U should minimize deviations from linearity and demonstrate that a “+U” correction will never worsen the deviation from linearity of the underlying xc approximation. However, we explain varying degrees of efficiency of the approach over 27 octahedral transition metal complexes with respect to transition metal (Sc–Cu) and ligand strength (CO, NH3, and H2O) and investigate select pathological cases where the delocalization error is invisible to DFT+U within an atomic projection framework. Finally, we demonstrate that the global and local curvatures represent different quantities that show opposing behavior with increasing ligand field strength, and we identify where these two may still coincide.},

During the past two decades, scaling relationships have been established for important heterogeneous catalytic reactions. More specifically, a physical or chemical property of the reaction system, termed as a reactivity descriptor, scales with another property often in a linear manner, which can describe and/or predict the catalytic performance. In this Review, we describe scaling relationships and reactivity descriptors for heterogeneous catalysis, including electronic descriptors represented by d-band theory, structural descriptors, which can be directly applied to catalyst design, and, ultimately, universal descriptors. The prediction of trends in catalytic performance using reactivity descriptors can enable the rational design of catalysts and the efficient screening of high-throughput catalysts. Finally, we outline methods to break scaling relationships and, hence, to break the constraint that active sites pose on the catalytic performance.},

In particular, the scaled version of a modified local density approximation predicts band gaps with an accuracy consistent for systems of all sizes, ranging from atoms and molecules to solids. The scaled modified local density approximation thus provides a useful tool to quantitatively characterize the size-dependent effect on the energy gaps of nanostructures.},

  abstract = {Delocalization error associated with the presently used density functional approximations is one of the main sources of errors which plague density functional theory calculations. In this paper, we give a comprehensive review on scaling correction (SC) approaches developed recently for reducing the delocalization error. The global and local SC approaches impose the rigorous Perdew-Parr-Levy-Balduz condition that the total electronic energy should scale linearly between integer electron numbers, on systems involving global and local fractional electron distributions, respectively. After presenting the theoretical background and mathematical formulation of scaling corrections, we demonstrate that they lead to universal alleviation of delocalization error. This is exemplified by the substantial improvement for the prediction of a wide range of electronic properties, including Kohn-Sham frontier orbital energies and band gaps, dissociation behavior of molecules, reaction barriers, electric polarizabilities, and charge-transfer species. The encouraging performances of SC approaches highlight their practicality and usefulness, and also affirm that an explicit treatment of fractional electron distributions is essentially important for reducing the intrinsic delocalization error. The existing limitations, the remaining challenges, and the future perspectives of SC are also discussed. Moreover, the SC approaches are compared with some existing methods attempting to remove the self-interaction error, such as the Perdew-Zunger self-interaction correction, the local hybrid hyper-generalized gradient approximations, and the rangeseparated density functional approximations. The unique advantages of SC suggest that it could open a novel and potentially paradigm-changing route for advancing density functional theory methods towards chemical accuracy.},

Many methods have been proposed to extract information about bonding from quantum chemical calculations, the majority of them resorting to molecular orbitals as basic descriptors. Here, we present a method called self-attractive Hartree (SAH) decomposition to unravel pairs of electrons directly from the electron density, which unlike molecular orbitals is a well-defined observable that can be accessed experimentally. The key idea is to partition the density into a sum of one-electron fragments that simultaneously maximize the self-repulsion and maintain regular shapes. This leads to a set of rather unusual equations in which every electron experiences self-attractive Hartree potential in addition to an external potential common for all the electrons. The resulting symmetry breaking and localization are surprisingly consistent with chemical intuition. SAH decomposition is also shown to be effective in visualization of ...}

The Perdew-Zunger SI correction (PZSIC), when applied in conjunction with the local spin density approximation (LSDA), improves the description of many properties, but overall, this improvement is limited. Here, we propose a modification to PZSIC that uses an iso-orbital indicator to identify regions where local SICs should be applied. Using this local-scaling SIC (LSIC) approach with LSDA, we analyze predictions for a wide range of properties including, for atoms, total energies, ionization potentials, and electron affinities and, for molecules, atomization energies, dissociation energy curves, reaction energies, and reaction barrier heights. LSIC preserves the results of PZSIC-LSDA for properties where it is successful and provides dramatic improvements for many of the other properties studied. Atomization energies calculated using LSIC are better than those of the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and close to those obtained with the strongly constrained and appropriately normed meta-GGA. LSIC also restores the uniform gas limit for the exchange energy that is lost in PZSIC-LSDA. Further performance improvements may be obtained by an appropriate combination or modification of the local scaling factor and the particular density functional approximation.},
